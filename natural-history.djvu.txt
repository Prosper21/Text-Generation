The only translation of Pliky's -Natural Histoet wliich 
has hitherto appeared in the English language is that by 
Philemon Holland, published in the latter part of the reign 
of Elizabeth. It is no disparagement to Holland's merits, 
as a diligent and generally faithful translator, to say that 
liis v/ork is unsuited to the requirements of the nineteenth 
century. 

In the present translation, the principal editions of 
Pliny have been carefully consulted, and no pains have 
been spared, as a reference to the Notes wiU show, to 
present to the reader the labours of recent Commentators, 
among whom stands pre-eminent the celebrated Cuvier. It 
has been a primary object to bring to the illustration of the 
work whatever was aftbrded by the progress of knowledge 
and modern discoveries in science and art. "Without ample 
illustration, Pliny's valuable work would want much of the 
interest which belongs to it, and present difficulties scarcely 
siu-mountable by any one who has not made the Author his 
especial study. 

In the first two Eooks, the text of Hardouin, as given in 
Lemaire's edition (Paris, 1827), has been followed ; in the 



Tl PREFACE . 

remainder tliat of Sillig (Grotha, 1851-3), excepting in some 
few instances, where, for reasons given in the Notes, it 
has been deemed advisable to depart from it. The first 
two Books, and portions of others, are the performance of 
the late Dr. Bostock, who contemplated a translation of 
the entire work ; but, unfortunately for the interests of 
science, he was not permitted to carry his design into 
execution. 

Upwards of a hundred pages had been printed off before 
the present Translator entered on his duties ; and as they 
had not the advantage of Dr. Bostock' s superintendence 
through the press, some trifling oversights have occurred. 
These are, for the most part, corrected in a short Appendix.

THE 

LIFE AND WHITINGS OF PLINY. 



Cattts Plinius SEcrNDUS was born either at Yerona or 
Novum Comum\ now Como, in Cisalpine Gaul, in the year 
A.u.c. 776, and a.d. 23. It is supposed that his earlier years 
were spent in his native province ; and that he was still a 
youth when he removed to Eome, and attended the lectures 
of the grammarian Apion. It was in about his sixteenth year 
that he there saw LoUia Paulina", as in the following she 
was divorced by Cahgula, and it was probably in his twen- 
tieth that he witnessed the captiu-e of a large fisli at Ostia, 
by Claudius and his attendants^ and in his twenty-second 
that he visited Africa^ Egypt, and Greece. 

In his twenty-third year Pliny served in Germany under 
the legatus Pomponius Secundus, whose friendship he soon 
acquired, and was in consequence promoted to the command 
of an ala, or troop of cavalry. During his military career 
he wrote a treatise (now lost) " On the Use of the Javelm 
by Cavalry," and travelled over that country^ as far as 
the shores of the German Ocean, besides visiting Belgic 
Gaul. In his twenty-ninth year he returned to Home, 
and applied himself for a time to forensic pursuits, which 
however he appears soon to have abandoned. About this 
time he wrote the life of his friend Pomponius, and an 
account of the "Wars in Germany," in twenty books, 
neither of which are extant. Though employed m writmg a

continuation of the "E-omanHistory"of AufidiusBassus,from 
the time of Tiberius, he judiciously suspended its publication 
during the reign of Nero, who appointed him his procurator 
in Nearer Spain, and not improbably honoured him with 
equestrian rank. It was during his sojourn in Spain that the 
death of his brother-in-law, C. Caecilius, left his nephew C, 
Plinius Caecilius Secundus (the author of the Letters) an or- 
phan; whom immediately upon his return to Rome, a.d. 70, he 
adopted, receiving him and his widowed mother under his roof. 

Having been previously known to Vespasian in the 
German wars, he was admitted into the number of his 
most intimate friends, and obtained an appointment at court, 
the nature of which is not known, but E-ezzonico conjec- 
tures that it was in connexion with the imperial treasury. 
Though Pliny was on intimate terms also with Titus, to 
whom he dedicated his Natural History, there is little 
ground for the assertion, sometimes made, that he served 
under him in the Jewish wars. His account of Palestine 
clearly shows that he had never visited that country. It 
was at this period that he published his Continuation of the 
History of Aufidius Bassus. 

From the titles which he gives to Titus in the dedicatory 
preface, it is pretty clear that his Natural History was pub- 
lished A.D. 77, two years before his death. 

In A.D. 73 or 74, he had been appointed by Vespasian 
praefect of the Homan fleet at Misenum, on the western coast 
of Italy. It was to this elevation that he owed his romantic 
death, somewhat similar, it has been remarked, to that of 
Empedocles, who perished in the crater of Mount JEtna. 
The closing scene of his active life, simultaneously with the 
destruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii, cannot be better 
described than in the language employed by his nephew in 
an Epistle to his friend Tacitus the historian^ : — " My uncle 
was at Misenum, where he was in personal command of the 
fleet. On the ninth^ day before the calends of September, at 
about the seventh hour, 1 p.m., my mother, observing the ap- 
pearance of a cloud of imusual size and shape, mentioned it to 
him. After reclining in the sun he had taken his cold 
bath ; he had tlien again lain down and, after a slight repast, 
applied himself to his studies. Immediately upon hear-

ing this, lie called for Ins shoes, and ascended a spot from 
which he could more easily observe this remarkable phae- 
nomenon. The cloud was to be seen gradually risiug up- 
wards ; though, from the great distance, it was uncertain 
from which of the mountains it arose ; it was afterwards, 
however, ascertained to be Vesuvius. In appearance and 
shape it strongly resembled a tree ; perhaps it v.as more like 
a pine than anything else, with a stem of enormous length 
reaching upwards to the heavens, and then spreading out in 
a number of branches in every direction. I have little doubt 
that eitlier it had been carried upwards by a violent gust of 
wind, and that the wind dying away, it had lost its com- 
pactness, or else, that being overcome by its own weight, it 
had decreased in density and become extended over a large 
surface : at one moment it was white, at another dingy and 
spotted, just as it Avas more or less charged with earth or 
with ashes. 

" To a man so eager as he was in the pursuit of knowledge, 
this appeared to be a most singular phaenomenon, and one that 
deserved to be viewed more closely; accordingly he gave 
orders for a light Liburnian vessel to be got ready, and lefb 
it at my option to accompany him. To this however I made 
answer, that I should prefer continuing my studies ; and as 
it so happened, he himself had just given me something to 
\ATite. Taking his tablets with him, he left the house. The 
sailors stationed at Eetina, alarmed at the imminence of the 
danger — for the village lay at the foot of the mountain, 
and the sole escape was by sea — sent to entreat his assist- 
ance in rescuing them from this frightful peril. Upon this 
he instantly changed his plans, and what he had already 
begun from a desire for knowledge, he determined to carry 
out as a matter of duty. He had the gallics put to sea at once, 
and went on board himself, witli the intention of rendering as- 
sistance, not only to Eetina, but to many other places as well ; 
for the whole of this charming coast w^as thickly populated. 
Accordingly he made all possible haste towards tlie spot, 
from which others were flying, and steered straiglit onwards 
into the very midst of the danger: so far indeed was he 
from every sensation of fear, that he remarked and had 
noted down every movement and every change tliat was to 
be observed in the appearance of this ominous eruption. 



X LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PLINT. 

The ashes were now falling fast upon the vessels, hotter 
and more and more thickly the nearer thej approached the 
shore ; showers of pumice too, intermingled with black 
stones, calcined and broken by the action of the flames : 
the sea suddenly retreated from the shore, where the debris 
of the mountain rendered landing quite impossible. After 
hesitating for a moment whether or not to turn back, upon 
the pilot strongly advising him to do so : — " Fortune favours 
the boldV said he, " conduct me to Pomponianus." Pom- 
ponianus was then at Stabise, a place that lay on the other 
side of the bay, for in tliose parts the shores are winding, 
and as they gradually trend away, the sea forms a number 
of little creeks. At this spot the danger at present was not 
imminent, but still it could be seen, and as it appeared to be 
approaching nearer and nearer, Pomponianus had ordered 
his baggage on board the ships, determined to take to 
flight, if the wind, which happened to be blowing the other 
way, should chance to lull. The wind, being in this quarter, 
was extremely favourable to his passage, and my uncle soon 
arriving at Stabiae, embraced his anxious friend, and did his 
best to restore his courage ; and tlie better to re-assure him 
by evidence of his own sense of their safety, he requested the 
servants to conduct him to the bath. After bathing he took 
his place at table, and dined, and that too in high spirits, or 
at all events, what equally shows his strength of mind, with 
every outward appearance of being so. In the mean time 
vast sheets of flame and large bodies of fire were to be seen 
arising from Mount Vesuvius ; the glare and brilliancy of 
which were beheld in bolder relief as the shades of night 
came on apace. My uncle however, in order to calm their 
fears, persisted in saying that this was only the light given 
by some villages whicli had been abandoned by the rustics 
in their alarm to the flames : after which he retired to rest, 
and soon fell fast asleep : for his respiration, which with him 
was heavy and loud, in consequence of his corpulence, was 
distinctly heard by the servants who were keeping watch at 
the door of the apartment. The courtyard which led to his 
apartment had now become filled with cinders and pumice- 
stones, to such a degree, that if he had remained any longer 
in the room, it would have been quite impossible for him to 
^ " Fortes fortuna juvat."

leave it. On being awoke lie immediately arose, and re- 
joined Pomponianus and the others who had in the mean- 
while been sitting up. They then consulted together whe- 
ther it would be better to remain in the house or take their 
chance in the open air ; as the building was now rocking to 
and fro from the violent and repeated shocks, while the walls, 
as though rooted up from their very foundations, seemed 
to be at one moment carried in this direction, at another 
in that. Having adopted the latter alternative, they were 
now alarmed at the showers of light calcined pumice-stones 
that were falling thick about them, a risk however to which 
as a choice of evils they had to submit. In taking this step 
I must remark that, while with my uncle it was reason tri- 
umphing over reason, with the rest it was only one fear 
getting the better of the other. Taking the precaution of 
placing pillows on their heads, they tied them on with towels, 
by way of protection against the falling stones and ashes. 
It was now day in other places, though there it was still 
night, more dark and more profound than any ordinary night ; 
torches however and various lights in some measure served 
to dispel the gloom. It was then determined to make for 
the shore, and to ascertain whether the sea would now admit 
of their embarking ; it was found however to be still too 
stormy and too boisterous to allow of their making the at- 
tempt. Upon this my uncle lay down on a sail which had 
been spread for him, and more than once asked for some 
cold water, which he drank ; very soon however, they were 
alarmed by the flames and the sulphurous smell which an- 
nounced their approach, upon which the others at once took to 
flight, while my uncle arose leaning upon two of the servants 
for support. Upon making this effort, he instantly fell to 
the ground ; the dense vapour having, I imagine, stopped the 
respiration and suffocated him ; for his cliest was natiu-ally 
weak and contracted, and often troubled with violent palpi- 
tations. When day was at last restored, the third after the 
closing one of his existence, his body was found vmtouched 
and without a wound ; there was no change to be perceived 
in the clothes, and its appearance was rather that of a per- 
pon asleep than of a corpse. In the meantime my mother 
and myself were at Misenum — that however has nothing 
to do with the story, as it was only your wish to know the

details connected with his death. I shall therefore draw to 
a conclusion. The only thing that I shall add is the assu- 
rance that I have truthfully related all these facts, of which 
I was either an eye-witness myself, or heard them at the 
time of their occurrence, a period w^hen they were most 
likely to he correctly related. You of course will select 
such points as you may think the most important. For it 
is one thing to write a letter, another to write history ; — one 
thing to write for a friend, another to write for the puhlic. 
Farewell." 

Of the mode of life pursued by Pliny, and of the rest of 
his works, an equally interesting account has been pre- 
served by his nephew, in an Epistle addressed to Macer^ 
We cannot more appropriately conclude than by present- 
ing this Epistle to the reader : — " I am highly gratified to 
find that you read the w^orks of my uncle with such a 
degree of attention as to feel a desire to possess them 
all, and that with this view you inquire, What are their 
names ? I will perform the duties of an index then : and 
not content with that, will state in what order they were 
written : for even that is a kind of information which is by no 
means undesirable to those who are devoted to literary pur- 
suits. His first composition was a treatise ' on the use of 
the Javelin by Cavalry,' in one Book. This he composed, 
with equal diligence and ingenuity, while he was in com- 
mand of a troop of horse. His second work was the ' Life 
of Q. Pomponius Secundus,' in two Books, a person by whom 
he had been particularly beloved. — These books he composed 
as a tribute which was justly due to the memory of his de- 
ceased friend. His next work was twenty Books on ' the 
Wars in Gi-ermany,' in which he has compiled an account of 
all the wars in which we have been engaged with the people 
of that country This he had begun while serving in 
G-ermany, having been recommended to do so in a dream. 
Eor in his sleep he thought that the figure of Drusus 
Nero"^ stood by him — the same Drusus, who after the 
most extensive conquests in that country, there met his

gustus. He was the father of the Emperor Claudius, and died in Grer-

death. Commending Lis memory to Pliny's attentive care, 
Drusus conjured him to rescue it from the decaying effect 
of oblivion. Next to these came his three books entitled 'The 
Student '\ divided, on account of their great size, into six 
volumes. In these he has given instructions for the training 
of the orator, from the cradle to his entrance on public 
life. In the latter years of Nero's reign, he wrote eight 
books, * On Difficulties in the Latin Language^ ;' that being 
a period at which every kind of study, in any way free-spoken 
or even of elevated style, would have been rendered danger- 
ous by the tyranny that was exercised. His next work was 
his ' Continuation of the History of Aufidius Bassus,' in 
thirty-one books ; after which came his ' Natural History,' 
in thirty-seven books, a work remarkable for its comprehen- 
siveness and erudition, and not less varied than Nature her- 
self. You will wonder how a man so occupied with business 
could possibly find time to write such a number of volumes, 
many of them on subjects of a nature so difficult to be 
treated of. You will be even more astonished when you 
learn, that for some time he pleaded at the bar as an advo- 
cate, that he was only in his fifty-sixth year at the time of 
his death, and that the time that intervened was equally 
trenched upon and frittered away by the most weighty duties 
of business, and the marks of favour shewn him by princes. 
His genius, however, was truly quite incredible, his zeal 
indefatigable, and his power of application wonderful in the 
extreme. At the festival of the Vulcanalia^, he began to 
sit up to a late hour by candle-light, not for the purpose of 
consulting'* the stars, but with the object of pursuing his 
studies ; while, in the winter, he would set to work at the 
seventh hour of the night, or the eightli at the very latest, 
often indeed at the sixths By nature he had the faculty of 
being able to fall asleep in a moment ; indeed, slumber would 
sometimes overtake him in his studies, and then leave him 
just as suddenly. Before daybreak, he was in the habit of 
attending the Emperor Vespasian, — for he, too, was one who 
made an excellent use of his nights, — and then betook him-

self to the duties with which he was charged. On his re- 
turn home, he devoted all the time which was still remaining 
to study. Taking an early repast, after the old fashion, 
light, and easy of digestion, in the summer time, if he had 
any leisure to spare, he would lie down in the sun-shine, 
while some book was read to him, he himself making notes 
and extracts in the meanwhile ; for it was his habit never to 
read anything without making extracts, it being a maxim of 
his, that there is no book so bad but that some good may be 
got out of it. After thus enjoying the sunshine, he gene- 
rally took a cold bath ; after which he would sit down to a 
slight repast, and then take a short nap. On awaking, as 
though another day had now commenced, he would study 
till the hour for the evening meal, during which some book 
was generally read to him, he making comments on it in a 
cursory manner. I remember, on one occasion, a friend of 
his interrupting the reader, who had given the wrong pro- 
nunciation to some words, and making him go over them 
again. " You understood him, didn't you ?" said my uncle. 
" Yes," said the other. " Why, then, did you make him go 
over it again ? Through this interruption of yours, we have 
lost more than ten lines." So thrifty a manager was he of 
time ! In summer he rose from the evening meal by day- 
light ; and, in winter, during the first hour of the night\ 
just as though there had been some law which made it com- 
pulsory on him to do so. This is how he lived in the midst 
of his employments, and the bustle of the city. When in 
retirement in the country, the time spent in the bath was 
the only portion that was not allotted by him to study. 
When I say in the bath, I mean while he was in the water ; 
for while his body was being scraped with the strigil and 
rubbed, he either had some book read to him, or else would 
dictate himself. While upon a journey, as though relieved 
from every other care, he devoted himself to study, and no- 
thing else. By his side was his secretary, with a book and 
tablets ; and, in the winter time, the secretary's hands were 
protected by gloves, that the severity of the weather might 
not deprive his master for a single moment of his services. 
It was for this reason also that, when at Eome, he would 
never move about except in a litter. I remember that on 
' At midwinter, this would be between six and seven in the evening. 



LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PLINT. XV 

one occasion lie found fault with me for walking — " You 
might have avoided losing all those hours," said he ; for he 
looked upon every moment as lost which was not devoted to 
study. It was by means of such unremitting industry as 
this that he completed so many works, and left me 160 
volumes of notes ^, written extremely small on both sides, 
which in fact renders the collection doubly voluminous. 
He himself used to relate, that when he was procurator in 
Spain, he might have parted with his common-place book to 
Largius Licinius for 400,000 sesterces ; and at that time the 
collection was not so extensive as afterwards. When you 
come to think of how much he must have read, of how much 
he has written, would you not really suppose that he had 
never been engaged in business, and had never enjoyed the 
favour of princes ? And yet, on the other hand, when you 
hear what laboiu- he expended upon his studies, does it not 
almost seem that he has neither written nor read enough ? 
For, in fact, Avhat pursuits are those that would not have 
been interrupted by occupations such as his ? While, again, 
what is there that such unremitting perseverance as his 
could not have effected ? I am in the habit, therefore, of 
laughing at it when people call me a studious man, — me 
who, in comparison with him, am a downright idler ; and 
yet I devote to study as much time as my public engage- 
ments on the one hand, and my duties to my friends on the 
other, will admit of. Wlio is there, then, out of all those 
who have devoted their whole life to literature, that ought 
not, when put in comparison with him, to quite blush at a 
life that would almost appear to have been devoted to 
slothfulness and inactivity ? But my letter has already 
exceeded its proper limits, for I had originally intended to 
write only upon the subject as to which you made inquiry, 
the books of his composition that he left. I trust, however, 
that these particulars will prove no less pleasing to you than 
the writings themselves ; and that they will not only induce 
you to peruse them, but excite you, by a feeling of generous 
emulation, to produce some work of a similar nature. —

Naturalis ' has survived to our times. This work, however,

is not a 'Natural History' in tlie modern acceptation of 
the term, but rather a vast Encyclopaedia of ancient know- 
ledge and belief upon almost every known subject — " not 
less varied than Nature herself," as his nephew says. It 
comprises, within the compass of thirty-seven books, 20,000 
matters of importance, collected from about 2000 vohimes 
(nearly all of which have now perished), the works, as Pliny 
himself states, of 100 writers of authority ; together with 
a vast number of additional matters unknovni to those au- 
thorities, and many of them the results of his own expe- 
rience and observation. Hardouin has drawn up a cata- 
logue of the authors quoted by Pliny; they amount in 
number to between 400 and 500. 

The following is a brief sketch of the plan of this wonderful 
monument of human industry. After a dedicatory Epistle to 
Titus, followedby a table of contents of the otherBooks, which 
together form the Eirst Book, the author proceeds to give 
an account of the prevailing notions as to the universe, the 
earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the more remarkable 
properties of the elements (^pai'tes naturce). He then passes 
on to a geographical description of the face of the earth as 
known to the ancients. After the Greography comes what may 
in strict propriety be termed " Natural History," including 
a history of man, replete indeed with marvels, but inter- 
esting in the highest degree. Having mentioned at consi- 
derable length the land, animals, fishes, birds, and insects, 
he passes on to Botany, which in its various aspects oc- 
cupies the larger portion of the work. At the same time, 
in accordance with his comprehensive plan, this part 
includes a vast amount of information on numerous subjects, 
the culture of the cereals and the manufacture of oil, wine, 
paper {'papyrus), and numerous other articles of daily use. 
After treating at considerable length of Medical Botany, 
he proceeds to speak of medicaments derived from the human 
body, from which he branches off into discussions on the 
history of medicine, and magic, which last he looks upon as 
an offshoot from the medical art ; and he takes this oppor- 
tunity of touching upon many of the then current supersti- 
tions and notions on astrology. He concludes this portion 
of his work with an account of the medicinal properties of 
various waters, and of those of fishes and other aquatic animals. 



LIFE AND WEITIKGS OF PLIIS^T. XVU 

He then presents us with a treatise on Mineralogy, in 
which he has accumulated every possible kind of inib:;;j- 
ation relative to the use of gold, silver, bronze, v.v.d 
other metals ; a subject which not unnaturally leads him 
into repeated digressions relative to money, jewels, plate, 
statues, and statuaries. Mineral pigments next occupy his 
attention, with many interesting notices of the great painters 
of Greece ; from which he passes on to the various kinds of 
stone and materials employed in building, and the use of 
marble for the purposes of sculpture, including a notice of 
that art and of the most eminent sculptors. The last Book 
is devoted to an account of gems and precious stones, and 
concludes with an eulogium on his native country, as alike 
distinguished for its fertility, its picturesque beauties, and 
the natural endowments and high destinies of its pepole. 

From the writings of Pliny we gather of course a large 
amount of information as to his opinions and the constitution 
of his mind. His credulity, it must be admitted, is great in 
the extreme ; though, singularly enough, he severely taxes the 
Greeks with the same failing ^ AYere we not assured from 
other sources that lie was eminently successful in life, was in 
the enjoyment of opulence, and honoured with the favour and 
confidence of princes^, the remarks which he frequently 
makes on human life, in the Seventh Book more especially, 
would have led us to the conclusion that he was a disap- 
pointed man, embittered against his fellow-creatures, and 
dissatisfied with the terms on which the tenure of life is 
granted to us. He opens that Book with a preface replete 
with querulous dissatisfaction and repinings at the lot of 
man — the only ' tearful ' animal — he says^. He repines at 
the helpless and wretched condition of the infant at the 
moment it is ushered into life, and the numerous pains and

outstripped his discretion. Though mdebted to them for by far the larg- 
est amount of liis information on almost every subject, he seems to have 
had a strong aversion to the Greeks, and repeatedly charges them with 
lying, viciousness, boasting, and vanity. See B. ii. c. 1 12 ; B. iii. c. 6 ;

vices to which it is doomed to be subject. — Man's liability 
to disease is with him a blemish in the economy of nature: 
— " life," he says, "this gift of nature, however long it 
may be, is but too uncertain and too frail ; to those 
even to whom it is most largely granted, it is dealt out with 
a sparing and niggardly hand, if we only think of eternity \" 
As we cannot have life on our own terms, he does not think 
it worthy of our acceptance, and more than once expresses 
his opinion that the sooner we are rid of it the better. Sud- 
den death he looks upon as a remarkable phsenomenon, but, at 
the same time, as the greatest blessing that can be granted to 
us^ : and when he mentions cases of resuscitation, it is only 
to indulge in the querulous complaint, that, " exposed as he 
is by his birth to the caprices of fortune, man can be certain 
of nothing; no, not even his own death^." Though any- 
thing but* an Epicurean, in the modern acceptation of the 
word, he seems to have held some, at least, of the tenets 
of Epicurus, in reference to the immortality of the soul. 
Whether he supposed that the soul, at the moment of death, 
is resolved into its previous atoms or constituent elements, 
he does not inform us ; but he states it as his belief, that 
after death the soul has no more existence than it had before 
birth ; that all notions of immortality are a mere delusion^ ; 
and that the very idea of a future existence is ridiculous, 
and spoils that greatest^ blessing of nature — death. He 
certainly speaks of ghosts or apparitions, seen after death ; 
but these he probably looked upon as exceptional cases, if 
indeed he believed'' in the stories which he quotes, of which 
we have no proofs, or rather, indeed, presumptive proofs to 
the contrary ; for some of them he calls " magna^ fabulose- 
tas," "most fabulous tales." 

In relation to human inventions, it is worthy of remark, 

1 See B, vii. e. 51. 

2 " Summa vitae felicitas." B. vii, c. 54. ^ g, yji ^ 53^ 

^ He loses no opportunity of inveighing against luxuiy and sensuality. 

^ The question as to a future existence he calls " Manium ambages," 
" quiddities about the Manes." B. vii. c. 56. ^ ggg ig yij c. 53. 

' We have already seen that in his earlier years he was warned in a 
vision by Drusus to write the liistory of the wars in Germany ; but 
there is a vast difference between paying attention to the suggestions of 
a dream, and beheving in the immortality of the soid, or the existence of 
disembodied spuits. ^ B. vii. c. 53.

that he states that the first^ thing in which mankind agreed, 
was the use of the Ionian alphabet ; the second, the practice 
of shaving- the beard, and the employment of barbers ; and 
the third, the division of time into hours. 

We cannot more appropriately conclude this review of 
the Life and Works of Pliny, than by quoting the opinions 
of two of the most eminent philosophers of modern times, 
Buiibn and Cuvier ; though the former, it must be admitted, 
has spoken of him in somewhat too high terms of commen- 
dation, and in instituting a comparison between Pliny's work 
and those of Aristotle, has placed in juxtaposition the names 
of two men who, beyond an ardent thirst for knowledge, had 
no characteristics in common. 

"Pliny," says Buftbn^, "has worked upon a plan which 
is much more extensive than that of Aristotle, and not im- 
probably too extensive. He has made it his object to em- 
brace every subject ; indeed he would appear to have taken 
the measure of K'ature, and to have found her too contracted 
for his expansive genius. His ' Natural History,' inde- 
pendently of that of animals, plants, and minerals, includes 
an account of the heavens and the earth, of medicine, com- 
merce, navigation, the liberal and mechanical arts, the 
origin of usages and customs, in a word, the history of all the 
natural sciences and all the arts of human invention. What, 
too, is still more astonishing, in each of tliese departments 
Pliny shows himself equally great. The grandeur of his 
ideas and the dignity of his style confer an additional lustre 
on the profoundjiess of his erudition ; not only did he know 
all that was known in his time, but he was also gifted with 
that comprehensiveness of view which in some measure mul- 
tiplies knowledge. He had all that delicacy of perception 
upon which depend so materially both elegance and taste, 
and he communicates to his readers that freedom of thought 
and that boldness of sentiment, whicli constitute the true 
germ of philosophy. His work, as varied as Nature herself, 
always paints her in her most attractive colours. It is, so to 
say, a compilation from all that had been written before liis 

1 B. vii. c. 58, 59, 60. 

' Mankind must surely have agreed before this in making the instru- 
ments employed, in shaving.

time : a record of all that was excellent or useful ; but this 
record has in it features so grand, this compilation contains 
matter grouped in a manner so novel, that it is preferable to 
most of the original works that treat upon similar subjects." 
The judgment pronounced by Cuvier on Pliny's work, 
though somewhat less highly coloured, awards to it a high 
rank among the most valuable productions of antiquity. 
" The work of Pliny V' says he, " is one of the most precious 
monuments that have come down to us from ancient times, 
and affords proof of an astonishing amount of erudition in 
one who was a warrior and a statesman. To appreciate 
with justice this vast and celebrated composition, it is 
necessary to regard it in several points of view — with re- 
ference to the plan proposed, the facts stated, and the 
style employed. The plan proposed by the writer is of 
immense extent — it is his object to write not merely a 
Natural History in our restricted sense of the term, not 
an account merely, more or less detailed, of animals, plants, 
and minerals, but a work which embraces astronomy, phy- 
sics, geography, agriculture, commerce, medicine, and the 
fine arts — and all these in addition to natural history pro- 
perly so called ; while at the same time he continually 
interweaves with his narrative information upon the arts 
which bear relation to man considered metaphysically, and 
the history of nations, — so much so indeed, that in many 
respects this work was the Encyclopaedia of its age. It was 
impossible in running over, however cursorily, such a pro- 
digious number of subjects, that the writer should not have 
made us acquainted with a multitude of facts, which, while 
remarkable in themselves, are the more precious from the 
circumstance that at the present day he is the only author 
extant who relates them. It is to be regretted however that 
the manner in which he has collected and grouped this 
mass of matter, has caused it to lose some portion of its 
value,, from his mixture of fable with truth, and more espe- 
cially from the difficulty, and in some cases, the impossibi- 
lity, of discovering exactly of what object^ he is speaking. 
But if Pliny possesses little merit as a critic, it is far other-

wise witli liis talent as a writer, and the immense treasury 
whicli he opens to us of Latin terms and forms of expres- 
sion : these, from the very abundance of the subjects upon 
which he treats, render his work one of the richest reposi- 
tories of the Roman language. Wherever he finds it possible 
to give expression to general ideas or to philosophical views, 
his language assumes considerable energy and \'ivacity, and 
his thoughts present to us a certain novelty and boldness 
which tend in a very great degree to relieve the dryness of 
his enumerations, and, with the majority of his readers, ex- 
cuse the insufiiciency of his scientific indications. He is 
always noble and serious, full of the love of justice and 
virtue, detestation of cruelty and baseness, of which he 
had such frightful instances before his eyes, and con- 
tempt for that unbridled luxury which in his time had 
so deeply corrupted the Roman people. For these great 
merits Pliny cannot be too highly praised, and despite the 
faults which we are obliged to admit in him when viewed as 
a naturalist, we are bound to regard him as one of the most 
meritorious of the Roman writers, and among those most 
worthy to be reckoned in the number of the classics who 
wrote after the reign of Augustus," 

and of whicli he has given the peeuhar properties, would have swollen, 
his book to a most enormous size, almost indeed beyond conception.

NATUEAL HISTORY OP PLINY,

DEDICATION. 

C, PLIIS^IUS SECUNDUS TO HIS TEIEND TITTJS YESPASIAN". 

This treatise on Natural History, a novel work in Homan 
literature, which I have just completed, I have taken the 
liberty to dedicate to you, most gracious^ Emperor, an appel- 
lation peculiarly suitable to you, while, on account of his 
age, that of great is more appropriate to your Father ; — 

" For still thou ne'er wouldst quite despise 
The trifles that I write 3 ; " 

if I may be allowed to shelter myself under the example of 
Catullus, my fellow-countryman'*, a military term, which you 
well understand. For he, as you know, when his napkins 
Lad been changed \ expressed himself a little harshly, from 

^ Lemaire informs us, in his title-page, that the two first books of the 
Natui'al EQstory are edited by M. Alexandi-e, in his edition. 

2 " Jucundissinae ;" it is not easy to find an epithet in our language 
•wliich will correctly express the meaning of the original, affectionate and 
lamihar, at the same time that it is sufiiciently dignified and respectful.

* " ConteiTaneus ; " we have no word in Enghsh wliich expresses the 
idea intended by the original, and which is, at the same time, a military 
term. There is indeed some reason to doubt, whether the word now 
inserted in the text was the one employed by the author : see the remarks 
of M. Alexandre, in Lem. i. 3 ; also an obseiwation in Cigalino's disser- 
tation on the native country of Pliny ; Valpy, 8.

liis anxiety to show liis friendship for his dear little Veranius 
and Fahius^. At the same time this my importunity may 
effect, what you complained of my not having done in an- 
other too forward epistle of mine ; it will put upon record, 
and let all the world know, with what kindness you exercise 
the imperial dignity. You, who have had the honour of a 
triumph, and of the censorship, have been six times consul, 
and have shared in the tribunate ; and, what is still more 
honourable, whilst you held them in conjunction with your 
Father, you have presided over the Equestrian order, and 
been the Prefect of the Prsetorians^ : all this you have done 
for the service of the Eepublic, and, at the same time, have 
regarded me as a fellow-soldier and a messmate. Nor has 
the extent of your prosperity produced any change in you, 
except that it has given you the power of doing good to the 
utmost of your wishes. And whilst all these circumstances 
increase the veneration which other persons feel for you, 
with respect to myself, they have made me so bold, as to wish 
to become more familiar. You must, therefore, place this 
to your owTi account, and blame yourself for any fault of this 
kind that I may commit. 

But, although I have laid aside my blushes^, I have not 
gained my object ; for you still awe me, and keep me at a 
distance, by the majesty of your understanding. In no one 
does the force of eloquence and of tribunitian oratory blaze 
out more powerfully ! With what glowing language do you 
thunder forth the praises of your Father ! How dearly do 
you love your Brother ! How admirable is your talent for 
poetry ! What a fertility of genius do you possess, so as to 

^ These names in tlie original are Yaraniolus and Fabullus, wMcli are 
supposed to have been changed from Yeranius and Fabiiis, as terms of 
familiarity and endearment ; see Poinsinet, i. 2 i, and Lemaire, i. 4. 

2 The narrative of Suetonius may serve to illustrate the observation of 
Pliny : " Triumphavit (Titus) cima patre, censiu'amque gessit una. Ei- 
dem coUega et in tribunicia potestate, et in septem consulatibus fuit. 
E-eceptaque ad se prope omnimn officiorum cm'a, cum patris nomine et 
epistolas ipse dictaret, et edicta conscriberet, orationesque in Senatu reci- 
taret etiam qusestoris vice, prsefecturam quoque prEetorii suscepit, nun- 
quam ad id tempus, nisi ab Equite Romano, admiaistratum." (viii. 5.) 

^ " Perfricui faciem." Tliis appears to have been a proverbial expres- 
sion among the Romans ; Cicero, Tusc. Qua;s. iii. 41, employs " os per- 
fricuisti," and Martial, xi. 27. 7, "perfricuit frontem," in the same sense.

enable you to imitate your Brotlier^ ! But who is there that 
is bold enough to form an estimate on these points, if he is 
to be judged by you, and, more especially, if you are chal- 
lenged to do so ? For the case of those Avho merely publish 
their works is very diiferent from that of those Avho ex- 
pressly dedicate them to you. In the former case I might 
say, Emperor ! why do you read these things ? They are 
written only for the common people, for farmers or mecha- 
nics, or for those who have nothing else to do ; why do you 
trouble yoiu-self with them ? Indeed, when I vmdertook 
this work, I did not expect that you would sit in judgement 
upon me" ; I considered your situation much too elevated 
for you to descend to such an office. Besides, we possess the 
right of openly rejecting the opinion of men of learning, 
M. Tullius himself, whose genius is beyond all competition, 
uses this privilege ; and, remarkable as it may appear, em- 
ploys an advocate in his own defence: — " I do not write for 
very learned people ; I do not wish my works to be read by 
Manius Persius, but by Junius Congus^." And if Lucilius, 
who first introduced the satirical style"*, applied such a re- 
mark to himself, and if Cicero thought proper to borrow it, 
and that more especially in his treatise " De E,epublica," 
how much reason have I to do so, who have such a judge to 
defend myself against ! And by this dedication I have de- 
prived myself of the benefit of challenge" ; for it is a very 
different thing whether a person has a judge given him by 
lot, or whether he voluntarily selects one ; and we always 
make more preparation for an invited guest, than for one 
that comes in unexpectedly.

from Lucihus, is not in the part of his treatise De Republica wliich was 
lately discovered by Angelus Mains ; Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 9. Cicero 
refers to this remark of Lucihus in two of his otlier works, although with 
a variation in the expression and in the individuals specilied ; De Orat. 
ii. 6, and De Fin. i. 3.

"When the candidates for office, during the heat of the 
canvass, deposited the fine^ in the hands of Cato, that de- 
termined opposer of bribery, rejoicing as he did in his being 
rejected from what he considered to be foolish honours, they 
professed to do this out of respect to his integrity; the 
greatest glory which a man could attain. It- was on this 
occasion that Cicero uttered the noble ejaculation, " How 
happy are you, Marcus Porcius, of whom no one dares to 
ask what is dishonourable^!" "When L. Scipio Asiaticus 
appealed to the tribunes, among whom was Grracchus, he 
expressed full confidence that he should obtain an acquittal, 
even from a judge w^ho was his enemy. Hence it follows, 
that he who appoints his own judge must absolutely submit 
to the decision ; this choice is therefore termed an appeal'^. 

I am well aware, that, placed as you are in the highest 
station, and gifted with the most splendid eloquence and 
the most accomplished mind, even those who come to pay 
their respects to you, do it with a kind of veneration : on 
this account I ought to be careful that what is dedicated to 
you should be worthy of you. But the country people, and, 
indeed, some whole nations offer milk to the Grods^, and those 
who cannot procure frankincense substitute in its place salted 
cakes ; for the Gods are not dissatisfied when they are wor- 
shiped by every one to the best of his ability. But my 
temerity will appear the greater by the consideration, that 
these volumes, which I dedicate to you, are of such inferior 
importance. For they do not admit of the display of genius, 
nor, indeed, is mine one of the highest order ; they admit of 
no excursions, nor orations, nor discussions, nor of any won- 
derful adventures, nor any variety of transactions, nor, from 
the barrenness of the matter, of anything particularly plea- 
sant in the narration, or agreeable to the reader. The na-

virum deponebant, qua scilicet multarentur, si imquam hujus criminis 
manifesti fierent."

ture of tilings, and life as it actually exists, are described in 
them ; and often the lowest department of it ; so that, in 
very many cases, I am obliged to nse rude and foreign, or 
even barbarous terms, and these often require to be intro- 
duced by a kind of preface. And, besides tliis, my road is 
not a beaten track, nor one which the mind is much disposed 
to travel over. There is no one among us who has ever at- 
tempted it, nor is there any one individual among the Grreeks 
who has treated of all the topics. Most of ns seek for no- 
thing but amusement in our studies, while others are fond 
of subjects that are of excessive subtilty, and completely in- 
volved in obscurity. My object is to treat of all those things 
wliich the Greeks include in the Encyclopaedia \ which, how- 
ever, are either not generally knowTi or are rendered dubious 
from our ingenious conceits. And there are other matters 
which many wTiters have given so much in detail that we 
quite loathe them. It is, indeed, no easy task to give novelty 
to what is old, and authority to what is new ; brightness to 
what is become tarnished, and light to what is obsciu-e ; to 
render what is slighted acceptable, and what is doubtful 
worthy of our confidence ; to give to all a natural manner, 
and to each its peculiar nature. It is sufficiently honour- 
able and glorious to have been willing even to make the at- 
tempt, although it should prove "unsuccessful. And, indeed, 
I am of opinion, that the studies of those are more especially 
worthy of our regard, who, after having overcome aU diffi- 
culties, prefer the useful office of assisting others to the 
mere gratification of giving pleasure ; and this is what I have 
already done in some of my former works. I confess it sur- 
prises me, that T. Livius, so celebrated an author as he is, 
in one of the books of his history of the city from its origin, 
should begin with this remark, " I have now obtained a suf- 
ficient reputation, so that I might put an end to my work, 
did not my restless mind require to be supported by employ- 
ment^." Certainly he ought to have composed this work, 
not for his own glory, but for that of the Eoman name, and 

^ "... id est, artiuin et doctrinanim omnium circulus ; " Alexandre 
in Lera. i. 14. 

2 These words are not found in any of the books of Livy now extant ; 
we may conclude that they were introduced into the latter part of his 
work.

of the people wlio were the conquerors of all other nations. 
It would liave been more meritorious to have persevered in 
his labours from his love of the work, than from the gratifi- 
cation which it afforded himself, and to have accomplished 
it, not for his own sake, but for that of the Eoman people. 

I have included in thirty-six^ books 20,000 topics, all 
worthy of attention, (for, as Domitius Piso^ says, we ought 
to make not merely books, but valuable collections,) gained 
by the perusal of about 2000 volumes, of which a few only 
are in the hands of the studious, on account of the obscurity 
of the subjects, produced by the careful perusal of 100 select 
authors^ ; and to these I have made considerable additions 
of things, which were either not known to my predecessors, 
or which have been lately discovered. JSTor can I doubt 
but that there still remain many things which I have omitted ; 
for I am a mere mortal, and one that has many occupations. 
I have, therefore, been obliged to compose this work at in- 
terrupted intervals, indeed during the night, so that you will 
find that I have not been idle even during this period. The 
day I devote to you, exactly portioning out my sleep to the 
necessity of my health, and contenting myself with this re- 
ward, that while we are musing'* on these subjects (accord- 
ing to the remark of Yarro), we are adding to the length of 
our lives ; for life properly consists in being awake. 

In consideration of these circumstances and these difficul- 
ties, I dare promise nothing; but you have done me the 
most essential service in permitting me to dedicate my work 
to you. Nor does this merely give a sanction to it, but it 
determines its value ; for things are often conceived to be of 
great value, solely because they are consecrated in temples.

times, beginning where Aufidius Bassus concludes \ You 
will ask, Wliere is it ? It has been long completed and its 
accuracy confirmed^ ; but I have determined to commit the 
charge of it to my heirs, lest I should have been suspected, 
during my lifetime, of having been unduly influenced by 
ambition. By this means I confer an obligation on those 
who occupy the same ground Avith myself; and also on 
posterity, who, I am aware, will contend with me, as I have 
done with my predecessors. 

Ton may judge of my taste from my having inserted, in 
the beginning of my book, the names of the authors that I 
have consulted. For I consider it to be courteous and to 
indicate an ingenuous modesty, to acknowledge the sources 
whence we have derived assistance, and not to act as most 
of those have done whom I have examined. Tor I must 
inform you, that in comparing various authors with each 
other, I have discovered, that some of the most grave and of 
the latest writers have transcribed, word for word, from 
former works, without making any acknowledgement ; not 
avowedly rivalling them, in the manner of Virgil, or with 
the candour of Cicero, who, in his treatise " De Eepublica^," 
professes to coincide in opinion with Plato, and in his Essay 
on Consolation for his Daughter, says that he follows 
Crantor, and, in his Offices^, Panaecius; volumes, which, as you 
well know, ought not merely to be always in our hands, but 
to be learned by heart. For it is indeed the mark of a per- 
verted mind and a bad disposition, to prefer being caught in

fidii Bassi intelligendus est non mors ejus, sed tempus ad quod sixas ipse 
perduxerat historias. Quodnara illud ignoramus." Lem. i. 18. For an 
account of Aufidius Bassus we are referred to the catalogue of Hardouin, 
but his name does not appear there. QuintiUan (x. 1) informs us, that 
he wTote an account of the Germanic war.

when we have acquired capital, by usurious interest \ 

The Greeks were wonderfully happy in their titles. One 
work they called Kripiov, which means that it was as sweet 
as a honeycomb ; another Kepas 'AfxaXdeias, or Cornu copise, 
so that you might expect to get even a di'aught of pigeon's 
milk from it^. Then they have their Flowers, their Muses, 
Magazines, Manuals, Gardens, Pictures, and Sketches^, all 
of them titles for which a man might be tempted even to 
forfeit his bail. But when you enter upon the works, O 
ye Gods and Goddesses ! how full of emptiness ! Our duller 
countrymen have merely their Antiquities, or their Examples, 
or their Arts. I think one of the most humorous of them has 
his jN'octurnal Studies'*, a term employed by Bibaculus ; a name 
which he richly deserved^. Yarrb, indeed, is not much be- 
hind him, when he calls one of his satires A Trick and a Half, 
and another Turning the Tables^. Diodorus was the first 
among the Greeks who laid aside this trifling manner and 
named his history The Library'^. Apion, the grammarian, 
indeed — he whom Tiberius Caesar called the Trumpeter of 
the World, but would rather seem to be the Bell of the 
Town-crier^, — supposed that every one to whom he inscribed 
any work would thence acquire immortality. I do not regret 
not having given my work a more fanciful title. 

That I may not, however, appear to inveigh so completely 
against the Greeks, I should wish to be considered under 
the same point of view with those inventors of the arts of 

* " Cum prsesertim sors fiat ex usura." The commentators and trans-

painting and sculpture, of wliom jou will find an account 
in these volumes, whose works, although they are so perfect 
that we are neyer satisfied with, admiring them, are inscribed 
with a temporary title \ such as " Apelles, or Polycletus, was 
doiDg this ; " implyiQg that the work was only commenced 
and still imperfect, and that the artist might benefit by the 
criticisms that were made on it and alter any part that 
required it, if he had not been prevented by death. It is 
also a great mark of their modesty, that they inscribed their 
works as if they were the last which they had executed, and 
as still in hand at the time of their death. I think there are 
but three works of art which are inscribed positively with 
the words " such a one executed this ; " of these I shall give 
an account in the proper place. In these cases it appears, 
that the artist felt the most perfect satisfaction ^^'iih. his work, 
and hence these pieces have excited the envy of every one. 

I, indeed, freely admit, that much may be added to my 
works ; not only to this, but to all which I have published. 
By this admission I hope to escape from the carping critics", 
and I have the more reason to say this, because I hear 
that there are certain Stoics and Logicians', and also Epi- 
cureans (from the Grrammarians"* I expected as much), who 
are big with something against the little work I published 
on Grrammar^ ; and that they have been carrying these 
abortions for ten years together — a longer pregnancy this 
than the elephant's^. But I well know, that even a woman 
once -v^Tote against Theophrastus, a man so eminent for his 
eloquence that he obtained his name, Avhich signifies the

Divine speaker^ and that from this circumstance originated 
the proverb of choosing a tree to hang oneself^. 

I cannot refrain from quoting the words of Cato the censor, 
which are so pertinent to this point. It appears from them, 
that even Cato, who wrote commentaries on military disci- 
pline^, and who had learned the military art under Africanus, 
or rather under Haiuiibal (for he could not endure Afri- 
canus"*, who, when he was his general, had borne away the 
triumph from him), that Cato, I say, was open to the attacks 
of such as caught at reputation for themselves by detracting 
from the merits of others. And what does he say in his 
book ? " I know, that when I shall publish what I have writ- 
ten, there will be many who will do all they can to depre- 
ciate it, and, especially, such as are themselves void of 
all merit ; but I let their harangues glide by me." Nor was 
the remark of Plancus^ a bad one, when Asinius Pollio^ was 
said to be preparing an oration against him, which was to 
be published either by himself or his children, after the 
death of Plancus, in order that he might not be able to 
answer it : " It is only ghosts that fight with the dead." 
This gave such a blow to the oration, that in the opinion of

in the editions of Yalpy, Lemaire, Ajasson, and Sillig. ; the Roman figures, 
enclosed between brackets, are the numbers of the chapters in Dalechamps,

The world \ and whatever that be which we otherwise 

^ " Mundus," In translating from one language into another, it is 
proper, as a general principle, always to render the same word in the 
original by the same word in the translation. But to this rule there are 
two exceptions ; where the languages do not possess words which pre- 
cisely correspond, and where the original author does not always use the 
same word in the same sense. Both these circumstances, I apprehend, 
apply to the case in question. The term Mimdus is used by Pliny, 
sometimes to mean the earth and its immediate appendages, the visible 
Bolar system ; and at other tunes the universe ; wlule I think we may 
venture to assert, that m some instances it is used in rather a vague 
manner, without any distinct reference to either one or other of the above 
designations. I have, in almost all cases, translated it by the term world j 
as approaching nearest to the sense of the original. The word miindus 
is frequently employed by Lucretius, especially in his fifth book, and 
seems to be ahnost always used in the more extended sense of universe. 
There are, indeed, a few passages where either meaning would be equally 
appropriate, and in one line it would appear to be equivalent to firma- 
ment or heavens ; " et mmidi spcciem violare serenam," iv. 138. Cicero, 
in his treatise I)e Natura Deorimi, generally uses the term mundus in the 
sense of universe, as in ii. 22, 37, 58 and 154 ; while in one passage, ii. 
132, it would appear to be employed in the more hmited sense of the 
earth. It occasionally occurs in the Fasti of Ovid, but it is not easy to 
ascertain its precise import ; as in the line *' Post chaos, ut primum data 
sunt tria corpora mundo," v. 41, where from the connexion it may be 
taken either m the more confined or in the more general sense. ManUius 
employs the word very frequently, and his commentators remark, that ho 
uses it in two distinct senses, the visible firmament and ihc universe; and 
I am induced to tliink that he attaches still more meaning to the term. 
It occui's three times in the first eleven hnes of liis poem. In the tliird 
line, " deducere mundo aggredior," mundus may be considered as equiva-

call the heavens \ by the vault of which all things are en- 
lent to the celestial regions as opposed to the earth. In the ninth line, 
" concessumque patri mundo," we may consider it as signifying the 
celestial regions generally ; and in the eleventh, " Jamque favet mundus," 
the whole of the earth, or rather its inhabitants. We meet with it again 
in the sixty-eighth hne, " lumina niimdi," where it seems more properly 
to signify the visible firmament ; again in the 139th, " Et mundi struxere 
globum," it seems to refer especially to the earth, synonymous with the 
general sense of the Enghsh term world ; while in the 153rd line, " per 
inania mundi," it must be supposed to mean the universe. Hyginus, 
in his Poeticon Astronomicon, hb. i. p. 55, defines the term as follows : 
•' Mimdus appellatur is qui constat in sole et hma et terra et omnibus 
stellis ; " and again, p. 57, "Terra mundi media regione coUocata." We may 
observe the different designations of the term mundus in Seneca ; among 
other passages I may refer to his Nat. Qugest. vii. 27 &amp; iii. 30 ; to his 
treatise De Consol. § 18 and De Benef. iv. 23, where I conceive the precise 
meanings are, respectively, the universe, the terrestrial globe, the firma- 
ment, and the heavenly bodies. The Grreek term Kofffios, which corresponds 
to the Latin word mundus, was likewise employed to signify, either the 
visible firmament or the universe. In illustration of tliis, it ^ill be suf- 
ficient to refer to the treatise of Aristotle Ilepi Kocjuov, cap. 2. p. 601. See 
also Stephens's Thesaurus, iti loco. In Apuleius's treatise De Mundo, 
which is a free translation of Aristotle's 11 ept Koa/xov, the term may be 
considered as synonymous with universe. It is used in the same sense 
in various parts of Apuleius's writings : see Metam. ii. 23 ; De Deo 
Socratis, 665, 667 ; De Dogmate Platonis, 574, 575, et alibi. 

^ Cicero, in his Timseus, uses the same phraseology ; " Omne igitur 
ccelum, sive mundus, sive quovis aho vocabulo gaudet, hoc a nobis 
nuncupatum est," § 2. Pomponius Mela's work commences vdth a 
similar expression ; " Omne igitur hoc, quidquid est, cui mmidi coehque 
nomen indideris, tmum id est." They were probably taken from a 
passage in Plato's Timaeus, "Universum igitur hoc, Coelum, sive Mimdum, 
sive quo aho vocabulo gaudet, cognominemus," accorduig to the trans- 
lation of Ficinus ; Platonis Op. ix. p. 302. The word coelum, which is 
employed in the original, in its ordinary acceptation, signifies the heavens^ 
the visible firmament ; as in Ovid, Met. i. 5, " quod tegit omnia, coelum." 
It is, in most cases, employed in this sense by Lucretius and by Manihus, 
as in i. 2. of the former and in i. 14. of the latter. Occasionally, how- 
ever, it is employed by both of these writers in the more general sense 
of celestial regions, in opposition to the earth, as by Lucretius, i. 65, and 
by Manilius, i. 352. In the hne quoted by Cicero from Pacuvius, it 
would seem to mean the place in which the planets are situated ; De 
Nat. Deor. ii. 91. The Greek word oiipavbs may be regarded as exactly 
cori'esponding to the Latm word caelum, and employed vnth. the same 
modifications ; see Aristotle, De Mundo and De Coelo, and Ptolemy, 
Mag. Const. Hb. i. passim ; see also Stephens's Thesaurus, in loco. Aratus 
generally uses it to designate the visible fib'mament, as in 1. 10, while in 
1. 32 it means the heavenly regions. Gresner defines coelvm, " Mundus

closed, we must conceive to be a Deity \ to be eternal, with- 
out bounds, neither created, nor subject, at any time, to 
destruction-. To inquire what is beyond it is no concern of 
man, nor can the liuman mind form any conjecture respecting 
it. It is sacred, eternal, and without bounds, all in all ; in- 
deed including ever^'thing in itself ; finite, yet like what is 
infinite ; the most certain of all things, yet like what is un- 
certain, externally and internally embracing all things in 
itself; it is the work of nature, and itself constitutes 
nature^. 

It is madness to harass the mind, as some have done, with 
attempts to measure the world, and to publish these attempts ; 
or, like others, to argue from what they have made out, 
that there are innumerable other worlds, and that we must 
believe there to be so many other natures, or that, if only 
one nature produced the whole, there Tvill be so many suns 
and so many moons, and that each of them will have immense 
trains of other heavenly bodies. As if the same question 
would not recur at every step of our inquiry, anxious as we 
must be to arrive at some termination ; or, as if this infinity, 
which we ascribe to nature, the former of all things, cannot 
be more easily comprehended by one single formation, 

eicluaa terra," and mtmdns, " Coelnin et quidqiiid coeli ambitu conti- 
netui*." In the passage from Plato, referred to above, the words which 
are translated by Ficmus caelum and mundics, are in the original ovpavos 
and Koo-juos ; Ficinus, however, in various parts of the Timseus, translates 
ovpavbs by the word miindus : see t. ix. p. 306, 311, et alibi. 

^ The following passage from Cicero may serve to illustrate the doctrine 
of Phny : " Novem tibi orbibus, vel potius globis, eonnexa sunt omnia : 
quorum unus est coelestis, extimus, qui reUquos omnes complectitur, 
summus ipseDeus, arcens etcontinens coelum ; " Som. Scip. § 4. I may 
remark, however, that the term here employed by our author is not Deus 
but Numen. 

2 We have an interesting account of the opinions of Aristotle on tliis 
subject, in a note in M. Ajasson's translation, ii. 234 et seq., which, as 
well as the greater part of the notes attached to the second book of the 
Natural History, were written by himself in conjunction with M. Marcus. 

'^ The pliilosophers of antiquity were divided in their opinions respect- 
ing the great question, whether tlie active properties of material bodies, 
which produce the pha^nomena of nature, are inherent in them, and 
necessarily attached to them, or whether they are bestowed upon them 
by some superior power or being. The Academics and Peripatetics 
generally adopted the latter opinion, the Stoics the former : Pliny adopts 
the doctrine of the Stoics ; see Enfield's Hist, of Phil. i. 229, 283, 331.

especially wlien that is so extensive. It is madness, perfect 
madness, to go out of this world and to search for what is 
beyond it, as if one who is ignorant of his own dimensions 
could ascertain the measure of any thing else, or as if the 
human mind could see what the world itself cannot contain. 

CHAP. 2. (2.) — or THE POEM OF THE WOELD^ 

That it has the form of a perfect globe we learn from 
the name which has been uniformly given to it, as well as 
from numerous natural arguments. Por not only does a 
figure of this kind return everywhere into itself^ and sustain 
itself, also including itself, requiring no adjustments, not 
sensible of either end or beginning in any of its parts, and is 
best fitted for that motion, with which, as will appear here- 
after, it is continually turning round ; but still more, because 
we perceive' it, by the evidence of the sight, to be, in every 
part, convex and central, which could not be the case were 
it of any other figure. 

CHAP. 3. (3.) — or ITS NATIIEE; WHEI^^CETHE ITAMEISDEEIYED. 

The rising and the setting of the sun clearly prove, 
that this globe is carried round in the space of twenty-four 
hours, in an eternal and never-ceasing circuit, and with in-

part, derived from Aristotle ; the few points ia which they differ will be 
stated in the appropriate places. 

2 Tliis doctrine was maintained by Plato in his Timseus, p. 310, and 
adopted by Aristotle, De Coelo, hb. ii. cap. 14, and by Cicero, De Nat. 
Deor- ii. 47. The spherical form of the world, ovpavbs, and its circular 
motion are insisted upon by Ptolemy, in the commencement of his astro- 
nomical treatise MeyaXr] ^vvra^is. Magna Constructio, frequently re- 
ferred to by its Arabic title Almagestum, cap. 2. He is supposed to have 
made his observations at Alexandria, between the years 125 and 140 A.D. 
His great astronomical work was translated into Arabic in the year 827 ; 
the original Greek text was first printed in 1538 by Grrynseus, with a 
commentary by Theon. George of Trebisond pubUshed a Latin version 
of it in 1541, and a second was pubhshed by Camerarius in 1551, along 
with Ptolemy's other works. John Muller, usually called Ecgiomontanus, 
and Purback pubUshed an abridgement of the Almagest in 1541. For an 
account of Ptolemy I may refer to the article in the Biog. Univ. xxxv. 
263 ei seq., by Delambre, also to Hutton's Math. Diet., in loco, and to 
the high character of him by Whewell, Hist, of the Inductive Sciences,,

credible swiftness ^ I am not able to say, whether the sound 
caused by the whirling about of so great a mass be excessive, 
and, therefore, far beyond what our ears can perceive, nor, 
indeed, whether the resounding of so many stars, all carried 
along at the same time and revolving in their orbits, may 
not produce a kind of delightfid harmony of incredible sweet- 
ness^. To us, who are in the interior, the world appears to 
glide silently along, both by day and by night. 

Various circumstances in natiu*e prove to us, that there 
are impressed on the heavens innumerable figures of animals 
and of all kinds of objects, and that its surface is not per- 
fectly polished like the eggs of birds, as some celebrated 
authors assert^. For w^e find that the seeds of all bodies fall 
do^Ti from it, principally into the ocean, and, being mixed 
together, that a variety of monstrous forms are in this way 
frequently produced. And, indeed, this is evident to the eye ; 
for, in one part, Ave have the figure of a wain, in another of 
a bear, of a bull, and of a letter"* ; while, in the middle of them, 
over our heads, there is a white circle^. 

(4.) AVith respect to the name, I am influenced by the 
unanimous opinions of all nations. For what the Greeks, 
from its being ornamented, have termed ivocr/jos, we, from its 
perfect and complete elegance, have termed oniindus. The 
name caelum, no doubt, refers to its being engraven, as it 

* See Ptolemy, uhi supra. 

2 This opinion, which was maintained by Pythagoras, is noticed and 
derided by Ai'istotle, De Coelo, hb. ii. cap. 9. p. 462-3. A brief account 
of Pythagoras's doctrine on this subject is contained in Enfield's Pliilo- 
sophy, i. 386. 

•* Phny probably here refers to the opinion which Cicero puts into the 
mouth of one of the interlocutors in his treatise De Nat. Deor. ii. 47, 
" Quid enun pulchrius ea figiu'a, quse sola omnes ahas figuras complesa 
continet, quseque nilul asperitatis habere, niliil offensionis potest, nihO.

■* The letter A, in the constellation of the triangle ; it is named Af Xrwrov 
by Ai'atus, 1. 235 ; also by Manihus, i. 360. We may remark, that, 
except in this one case, the constellations have no visible resemblance to 
the objects of which they bear the name. 

^ " Locum hmic Phnii de Gralaxia, sive Lactea via, interpretantur omnes

word vertex is here used in the sense of the astronomical term zenith, 
not to signify the pole.

were, witloi the stars, as Yarro suggests ^ In confirmation of 
this idea we may adduce the Zodiac^, in which are twelve 
figures of animals ; through them it is that the sun has con- 
tinued its course for so many ages. 

CHAP. 4. (5.) — or THE ELEMENTS^ AlfD THE PLAISTETS^. 

I do not find that any one has doubted that there are 
four elements. The highest of these is supposed to be fire, 
and hence proceed the eyes of so many glittering stars. The 
next is that spirit, which both the Greeks and ourselves call 
by the same name, air^. It is by the force of this vital prin- 
cijDle, pervading all things and mingling with all, that the 
earth, together with the fourth element, water, is balanced in 

^ De Ling. Lat. lib. iv. p. 7, 8. See also the remarks on the derivation of 
the word in Gresner, Thes., in loco. 

2 "Signifer." The EngHsh term is taken from the Greek word 
Zw^iaKos, derived from Zwov ; see Aristotle, De Mundo, cap. 2. p. 602. 
The word Zodiacus does not occur in PHny, nor is it employed by 
Ptolemy ; he names it Xo^os kvkXos, obliquus circidus ; Magn. Const, i. 
7, 13, et alibi. It is used by Cicero, but professedly as a Greek term ; 
Divm. ii. 89, and Arati Phsenom. 1. 317. It occurs in Hyginus, p. 57 
et alibi, and in A. GeUius, 13. 9. Neither signifer taken substantively, 
nor zodiacus occur in Lucretius or in Manihus. 

3 The accoxmt of the elements, of their nature, difference, and, more 
especially, the necessity of their being four, are folly discussed by 
Aristotle in various parts of his works, more particularly in his treatise 
De Coelo, hb. iii. cap. 3, 4 and 5, lib. iv. cap. 5, and De Gener. et Cor. 
hb. ii. cap. 2, 3, 4 and 5. For a judicious summary of the opinions of 
Aristotle on this subject, I may refer to Stanley's History of Philosophy; 
Aristotle, doctrines of, p. 2. 1. 7, and to Enfield, i. 764 et seq. For 
the Epicm'ean doctrine, see Lucretius, i. 764 et seq. 

^ Although the word planeta, as taken from the Greek TrXavfjrrjs, is 
inserted in the title of this chapter, it does not occur in any part of the 
text. It is not found either in Lucretius, Manihus, or Seneca, nor, I 
beheve, was it used by any of their contemporaries, except Hyginus, p. 76. 
The planets were generally styled stellcs erraticce, errantes, or vagce^ 
sidera palantia, as in Lucretius, ii. 1030, or simply the five stars, as in 
Cicero, De Nat. Deor. ii. 51, and in Seneca, Nat. Qusest. vii. 24. PHny, 
by including the sun and moon, makes the number seven. Ai-atus calls 
them TrevT dffrepes, 1. 454.

the middle of space. These are mutually hound together, the 
lighter being restrained by the heavier, so that they cannot 
fly off; while, on the contrary, from the lighter tending up- 
wards, the heavier are so suspended, that they cannot fall 
doAvn. Thus, by an equal tendency in an opposite direction, 
each of them remains in its appropriate place, bound together 
by the never-ceasing revolution of the world, which ahyays 
turning on itself, the earth falls to the lowest part and is in 
the middle of the whole, Avhile it remains suspended in the 
centre \ and, as it were, balancing this centre, in which it is 
suspended. So that it alone remains immoveable, whilst all 
things revolve round it, being connected with every other 
part, whilst they all rest upon it. 

(6.) Between this body and the heavens there are sus- 
pended, in this aerial spirit, seven stars^, separated by determi- 
nate spaces, which, on account of their motion, we call wander-

hoc ipso libro, cap. 6i, terrain coeli cardinem esse dicit ; " Alexandi^e, in 
Lem. i. 228. On this subject I may refer to Ptolemy, Magn. Const, 
hb. i. cap. 3, 4, 6. See also Apuleius, near the commencement of his 
treatise De Mundo. 

2 " Sidera." The word sidus is used, in most cases, for one of the 
heavenly bodies generally, sometimes for what we term a constellation, 
a particidar assemblage of them, and sometimes specially for an individual 
star. Manihus employs the word in all these senses, as will appear by 
the tliree following passages respectively ; the first taken from the open- 
ing of his poem, 

" Carmine divinas artes, et conscia fati 
Sidera . . . . " 

The second, " Hsec igitm' texunt gequali sidera tractu 

Ignibus in varias coelum laqueantia formas." i. 275, 276. 

The third " . . . . pectus, ftdgenti sidere clarius ; " i. 356. 

In the Fasti of Ovid, we have examples of the two latter of these 
significations : — 

"Ex Ariadnseo sidere nosse potes ;" v. 346. 

" Et canis (Icarium dicunt) quo sidere note 
Tosta sitit tcllus ; " iv. 939, 940. 

Lucretius appears always to employ the term in the general sense. J. 
Obsequens appHes the word sidus to a meteor ; " sidus ingcns ccelo 
demissum," cap. 16. In a subsequent part of this book, chap. 18 et seq.^ 
our author more particularly restricts the term iddus to the planets.

ing, althougli, in reality, none are less so^ The sun is carried 
along in the midst of these, a body of great size and power, 
the ruler, not only of the seasons and of the different climates, 
hut also of the stars themselves and of the heavens^'. When 
we consider his operations, we must regard him as the life, 
or rather the mind of the universe, the chief regulator and 
the Grod of nature ; he also lends his light to the other stars ^. 
He is most illustrious and excellent, beholding all things 
and hearing all things, which, I perceive, is ascribed to him 
exclusively by the prince of poets, Homer^. 

CHAP. 5. (7.) — OF GOD^ 

1 consider it, therefore, an indication of human weakness 
to inquire into the figure and form of Grod. For whatever 
Grod be, if there be any other God^, and wherever he ex- 
ists, he is all sense, all sight, all hearing, all life, all mind^, 
and all within himself. To believe that there are a number 
of Gods, derived from the virtues and vices of man^, as 
Chastity, Concord, Understanding, Hope, Honour, Clemency,

3 " ceteris sideribiis." According to Hardouin, uhi supra, " niTniuTn 
stellis errantibus." There is, however, nothing in the expression of our 
author which sanctions this limitation. 

4 See Ihad, ui. 2V7, and Od. xii. 323. 

5 It is remarked by Enfield, Hist, of Phil. ii. 131, that " with respect 
to philosophical opinions, Phny did not rigidly adhere to any sect. . . . 
He reprobates the Epicurean tenet of an infinity of worlds ; favours the 
Pythagorean notion of the harmony of the spheres ; speaks of the universe 
as God, after the manner of the Stoics, and sometimes seems to pass over 
into the field of the Sceptics. Eor the most part, however, he leans to 
the doctrme of Epicm-us." 

^ " Siahus est Deus quam sol," Alexandre in Lem. i. 230. Or rather, 
if there be any Grod distinct from the world ; for the latter part of the 
sentence can scarcely apply to the sun. Poinsinet and Ajasson, however, 
adopt the same opinion with M. Alexandre ; they translate the passage, 
" s'il en est autre que le soleil," i. 17 and ii. 11. 

" " totus animae, totus animi ; " " Anima est qua vivimus, animus quo 
sapimus." Hard, in Lem. i. 230, 231. The distinction between these two 
words is accurately pointed out by Lucretius, iii. 137 et seq.

and ridelity ; or, according to the opinion of Democritus, 
that there are only tAvo, Pimishment and Ee\Yard\ indicates 
still greater folly. Hnman nature, Aveak and frail as it is, 
mindl'ul of its OAvn infirmity, has made these divisions, so 
that every one might have recourse to that which he supposed 
himself to stand more particularly in need of-. Hence we 
find difterent names employed by difi'erent nations ; the 
inferior deities are arranged in classes, and diseases and 
plagues are deified, in consequence of our anxious wish to 
propitiate them. It was from this cause that a temple was 
dedicated to Fever, at the public expense, on the Palatine 
HilP, and to Orbona^, near the Temple of the Lares, and 
that an altar was elected to Grood Fortime on the Esquiline. 
Hence we may understand how it comes to pass that there 
is a greater population of the Celestials than of human beings, 
since each individual makes a separate God for himself, 
adopting his own Juno and his own Genius ■\ And there 
are nations who make Gods of certain animals, and even 
certain obscene things*', which are not to be spoken of, 
swearing by stinking meats and such like. To suppose 
that marriages are contracted between the Gods, and that, 
during so long a period, there should have been no issue 

1 The account which Cicero gives us of the opinions of Democritus 
scarcely agrees with the statement in the text ; see De Nat. Deor. i. 120.

Faniim, ^des, and Templum^ which are employed in this place by Pliny 
and Val. Maximus. Gresner defines Fanum " area tcmpU et sohimi, 
templum vero sedificium ; " but tliis distinction, as he informs us, is not 
always accurately observed; there appears to be stiU less distmction 
between ^des and Templum ; see his Thesaurus in loco, also Bailey's 
Facciolati in loco.

■from them, that some of them should be old and always grey- 
headed and others young and like children, some of a dark 
complexion, winged, lame, produced from eggs, living and 
dying on alternate days, is sufficiently puerile and foolish. 
But it is the height of impudence to imagine, that adultery 
takes place between them, that they have contests and 
quarrels, and that there are Grods of theft and of various 
crimes \ To assist man is to be a Grod; this is the path to 
eternal glory. This is the path which the Roman nobles 
formerly pursued, and this is the path which is now pursued 
by the greatest ruler of our age, Vespasian Augustus, he 
who has come to the relief of an exhausted empire, as well 
as by his sons. This was the ancient mode of remunerating 
those who deserved it, to regard them as Grods^. For the 
names of all the Gods, as well as of the stars that I have 
mentioned above^, have been derived from their services to 
mankind. And with respect to Jupiter and Mercury, and 
the rest of the celestial nomenclature, who does not admit 
that they have reference to certain natural phsenomena'* ? 

But it is ridiculous to suppose, that the great head of all 
things, whatever it be, pays any regard to human affairs^. 

* See Cicero, De ISTat. Deor. i. 42 et alibi, for an illustration of these 
remarks of Pliny. 

2 Tliis sentiment is elegantly expressed by Cicero, De Nat. Deor. ii. 62, 
and by Horace, Od. iii. 3. 9 et seq. It does not appear, however, that 
any of the Eomans, except Komulus,were deified, previous to the adulatory 
period of the Empire. 

3 " Planetarum nempe, qui omnes nomina mutuantur a diis.' ' Alexandre 
in Lematre, i. 234. 

•* This remark may be illustrated by the following passage from Cicero, 
io^ the fh'st book of his treatise De Nat. Deor. Speaking of the doctrine 
of Zeno, he says, "neque enim Jovem, neque Junonem, neque Vestam, 
neque quemquam, qui ita appeUetur, in deorvan habet numero : sed rebus 
manimis, atque mutis, per quandam significationem, heec docet tributa 
nomina." " Idemque (Cluysippus) disputat, sethera esse cum, quern 
homines Jovem appellant : quique aer per maria manaret, eum esse Nep- 
tunmn : terramque earn esse, quae Ceres diceretiu- : simihque ratione 
persequitur vocabula reli quorum deorum." 

5 The following remarks of Lucretius and of Cicero may serve to illus- 
trate the opinion here expressed by our author : — 

" Omnis enim per se Divum natura necesse est 
Immortah sevo summa cmn pace fruatiu* 
Somota ab nostris rebus, sejunctaque longe; " Lucretius, i. 57-59. 

" Quod sDtcrnum bcatumque sit, id nee habere ipsum negotii qviid-

Can we believe, or rather can there be any doubt, that it is 
not polhited by such a disagreeable and complicated office ? 
It is not easy to determine which opinion would be most 
for the advantage of mankind, since we observe some who 
have no respect for the Gods, and others who carry it to a 
scandalous excess. They are slaves to foreign ceremonies ; 
they carry on their fingers the Gods and the monsters whom 
they worship^; they condemn and they lay great stress on 
certain kinds of food ; they impose on themselves dreadful 
ordinances, not even sleeping quietly. They do not marry 
or adopt children, or indeed do anything else, without the 
sanction of their sacred rites. There are others, on the con- 
trary, who will cheat in the very Capitol, and will forswear 
themselves even by Jupiter Tonans^, and while these thrive 
in their crimes, the others torment themselves with their 
superstitions to no purpose. 

Among these discordant opinions mankind have discovered 
for themselves a kind of intermediate deity, by which our 
scepticism concerning God is still increased. For all over 
the world, in all places, and at all times. Fortune is the only 
god whom every one invokes ; she alone is spoken of, she 
alone is accused and is supposed to be guilty ; she alone is 
in our thoughts, is praised and blamed, and is loaded with 
reproaches ; wavering as she is, conceived by the generality 
of mankind to be blind, wandering, inconstant, uncertain, 
variable, and often favouring the unworthy. To her are re- 
ferred all our losses and all our gains, and in casting up the 
accounts of mortals she alone balances the two pages of our 
sheet^. AVe are so much in the power of chance, that change 
itself is considered as a God, and the existence of God be- 
comes doubtful. 

But there are others who reject this principle and assign 
events to the influence of tlie stars'*, and to the laws of our

decrees and never afterwards interferes. This opinion be- 
gins to gain ground, and both the learned and the unlearned 
vulgar are falling into it. Hence we have the admonitions 
of thunder, the w^arnings of oracles, the predictions of sooth- 
sayers, and things too trifling to be mentioned, as sneezing 
and stumbling with the feet reckoned among omens \ The 
late Emperor Augustus'-^ relates, that he put the left shoe on 
the wrong foot, the day when he was near being assaulted 
by his soldiers^. And such things as these so embarrass 
improvident mortals, that among all of them this alone is 
certain, that there is nothing certain, and that there is no- 
thing more proud or more wretched than man. For other 
animals have no care but to provide for their subsistence, 
for which the spontaneous kindness of nature is all-suffi- 
cient ; and this one circumstance renders their lot more 
especially preferable, that they never think about glory, or 
money, or ambition, and, above all, that they never reflect 
on death. 

The belief, however, that on these points the Grods super- 
intend human affairs is useful to us, as well as that the 
punishment of crimes, although sometimes tardy, from the 
Deity being occupied with such a mass of business, is never 
entirely remitted, and that the human race was not made 
the next in rank to himself, in order that they might be de- 
graded like brutes. And indeed this constitutes the great 
comfort in this imperfect state of man, that even the Deity

ally, a constellation ; as in Marulius, i. 541, 2.

EngHsh word stars. See Gresner's Thesaiu'us,

2 " Divus Augustus." The epithet divus may be regarded as merely a 
term of court etiquette, because all the Emperors after death were deified 
ex officio.

" .... si mane sibi calceus perperam, et sinister pro dextro induceretur ; " 
Augustus, Cap. 92. From tliis passage it woxild appear, that the Koman 
sandals were made, as we term it, right and left.

cannot do everything. For be cannot procure death for 
himself, even if he wished it, which, so numerous are the 
evils of life, has been granted to man as our chief good. Nor 
can he make mortals immortal, or recall to life those who 
are dead ; nor can he effect, that he who has once lived shall 
not have lived, or that he who has enjoyed honours shall not 
have enjoyed them ; nor has he any influence over past 
events but to cause them to be forgotten. And, if we -illus- 
trate the nature of our coimexion with God by a less serious 
argument, he cannot make twice ten not to be twenty, and 
many other things of this kind. By these considerations the 
power of Nature is clearly proved, and is sho-\Mi to be what 
we call Grod. It is not foreign to the subject to have di- 
gressed into these matters, familiar as they are to every one, 
from the continual discussions that take place respecting 
God\ 

CHAP. 6. (8.) — OF THE XATUKE OF THE STARS ; OF THE 
MOTIOIf OF THE PLAKETS. 

Let us return from this digression to the other parts 
of nature. The stars which are described as fixed in the 
heavens-, are not, as the vulgar suppose, attached each of 
them to different individuals^, the brighter to the rich, those 
that are less so to the poor, and the dim to the aged, shining 
according to the lot of the individual, and separately assigned 
to mortals ; for they have neither come into existence, nor 

^ It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the opinions here stated re- 
specting the Deity are taken partly from the tenets of the Epicureans, 
combined with the Stoical doctrine of Fate. The examples which are ad- 
duced to prove the power of fate over the Deity are, for the most part, 
rather verbal than essential. 

2 " afFixa mundo." The peculiar use of the word mundus in this pas- 
sage is worthy of remark, in connexion with note ^, ch. 1. page 13. 

3 We have many references in Phny to the influence of the stars upon 
the earth and its inhabitants, constituting what was formerly regarded as 
so important a science, judicial astrology. Ptolemy has drawn up a 
regular code of it in his " Centum dicta," or " Centiloquimns." We 
have a higlily interesting account of the supposed science, its origin, pro- 
gress, and general principles, in Whewell's History of the Inductive Sci- 
ences, p. 293 et seq. I may also refer to the same work for a sketch of 
the history of astronomy among the Greeks and the other nations of 
antiquity.

do they, perish in connexion with particular persons, nor 
does a falling star indicate that any one is dead. We are 
not so closely connected with the heavens as that the shining 
of the stars is affected by our death \ "When they are sup- 
posed to shoot or fair^, they throw out, by the force of their 
fire, as if from an excess of nutriment, the superabundance 
of the humour Avhich they have absorbed, as we observe to 
take place from the oil in our lamps, when they are bm-ning^. 
The nature of the celestial bodies is eternal, being inter- 
woven, as it were, with the world, and, by this union, ren- 
dering it solid ; but they exert their most powerful influence 
on the earth. This, not-sAdthstanding its subtilty, may be 
knoA^Ti by the clearness and the magnitude of the efiect, as 
we shall point out in the proper place'*. The account of the 
circles of the heavens will be better imderstood when we 
come to speak of the earth, since they have all a reference to 
it ; except w^hat has been discovered respecting the Zodiac, 
which I shall now detail. 

Anaximander the Milesian, in the 58th olympiad^, is said 
to have been the first w^ho understood its obliquity, and thus 
opened the road to a correct knowledge of the subject^. 

1 There are certain metapliorical expressions, which, have originated 
from this opinion, adopted by the moderns; " his star is set;" " the 
star of his fortune," &amp;c. 

2 Ovid, when he compares Phaeton to a faUuig star, remarks, con- 
cerning tliis meteor, — 

" Etsi non cecidit, potuit ceeidisse videri." Metam. ii. 322. 

3 Manihus supposes that comets are produced and rendered luminous 
by an operation very similar to the one described in the text ; i. 815 et seq. 
Seneca, in the commencement of his Nat. Qusest., and in other parts of 
the same treatise, refers to tliis subject. His remarks may be worth 
perusing by those who are curious to learn the hypotheses of the ancients 
on subjects of natural science. We may remark, that Seneca's opinions 
are, on many points, more correct than our author's. 

^ The author probably refers to that part of his work in wliich he 
treats on agricultm-e, particTilarly to the l7th and 18th books. 

5 The sera of the Olympiads commenced in the year 776 before Christ ; 
each olympiad consists of 4 years ; the 58tli olympiad will therefore 
include the hiterval 548 to 544 B.C. The 21st vol. of the " Universal 
History " consists entirely of a " clironological table," and we have a 
useful table of the same kind in Brewster's Encycl., article "Chronology." 

^ " rerura fores apcruisse .... tradittu*." An account of the astro- 
nomy of Anaximander is contained in Brewster's Encycl., article " Astro-

Afterwards Cleostratus made the signs in it, first marking 
tliose of Aries and Sagittarius ; Atlas bad formed the sphere 
long before this time^ But now, leaving the further con- 
sideration of this subject, we must treat of the bodies that 
are situated between the earth and the heavens". 

It is certain that the star called Saturn is the highest, and 
therefore appears the smallest, that he passes through the 
largest circuit, and that he is at least thirty years in com- 
pleting it^. The course of all the planets, and among others 
of the Sun, and the Moon, is in the contrary direction to 
that of the heavens"*, that is towards the left, while the hea-

^ In the translation of Ajasson, ii. 261-7, we have some valuable ob- 
servations by Marcus, respecting the origm and progress of astronomy 
among the Greeks, and the share wliich the mdividuals mentioned in the 
text respectively had in its advancement ; also some interestmg remarks 
on the history of Atlas. Diodorus Siculus says, that " he was the fu*st 
that discovered the knowledge of the sphere ; whence arose the common 
opinion, that he cari'ied the world upon lus shoulders." Booth's trans, 
p. 115. 

- " nvmc relicto mundi ipsius corpore, rchqua mter ca?lum teiTasque 
tract entm'." I have already had occasion to remark upon the various 
modes in which the author uses the word mundus ; by caelum, in this 
passage, he means the body or region beyond the planets, wliich is con- 
ceived to contain the fixed stars. Splicer a, m the preceding sentence, 
may be supposed to mean the celestial globe. 

3 " ac trigesimo anno ad brevissima sedis suae principia rogi'cdi;" I 
confess myself luiable to offer any hteral explanation of this passage ; nor

veils are rapidly carried about to the rights And althougli, 
by tbe stars constantly revolving with immense velocity, 
they are raised up, and hurried on to the part where they 
set, yet they are all forced, by a motion of their own, in an 
opposite direction^ ; and this is so ordered, lest the air, being 
always moved in the same direction, by the constant whirling 
of the lieavens, should accumulate into one mass, whereas 
now it is divided and separated and beaten into small pieces, 
by the opposite motion of the different stars. Saturn is a 
star of a cold and rigid nature, while the orbit of Jupiter is 
much lower, and is carried round in twelve years^ The next 
star. Mars, which some persons call Hercules ^ is of a fiery 
and burning nature, and from its nearness to the sun is carried 
round in little less than two years ^ In consequence of 
the excessive heat of this star and the rigidity of Saturn, 
Jupiter, which is interposed between the two, is tempered 
by both of them, and is thus rendered salutary. The path 
of the Sun consists of 360 degrees; but, in order that the 
shadow may return to the same point of the diaP, we are 
obliged to add, in each year, five days and the fourth part of 
a day. On this account an intercalary day is given to every 
fifth year^, that the period of the seasons may agree with 
that of the Sun. 

1 Our author supposes, that the spectator has his face directed towards 
the south, as is the case with the modern observers. We are, however in- 
formed by Hardouin, that tliis was not the uniform practice among the 
ancients ; see the remarks of Alexandre in Lemaire, ii. 243,, and of Mar- 
cus in Ajasson, ii. 269. 

2 The constant revolution refers to the apparent daUy motion ; the 
opposite direction to their annual course through the zodiac. Ptolemy 
gives an account of this double motion in his Magna Constructio, i. 7. 

3 For the exact period, according to Somerville and Herschel, see 
note 3, p, 27. 

^ Aristotle informs us, that Mars was also called Hercules or Pyrosis ; 
De Mundo, cap. ii. p. 602. See also Apuleius, De Mundo, § 710. Hy- 
gmus is said by Hardouin to give the name of Hercules to the planet 
Mars, but this appears to be an inaccuracy ; he describes the planet imder 
its ordinary appellation ; hb. ii. p. 62 ; and ii. 78, 9. 

5 Cicero, speaking of the period of Mars, says, " Quatuor et vigiati 
mensibus, sex, ut opinor, diebus minus ;" DeNat. Deor. For the exact 
period, see note 3, p. 27.

Below the Sun^ revolves the great star called Yenus, wan- 
dering with an alternate motion^, and, even in its surnames, 
rivalling the Sun and the Moon. For when it precedes the 
day and rises in the morning, it receives the name of Lucifer, 
as if it were another sun, hastening on the day. On the 
contrary, when it shines in the west, it is named Vesper, as 
prolonging the light, and performing the office of the moon. 
Pythagoras, the Samian, was the hrst who discovered its 
nature^, about the 62nd olympiad, in the 222nd year of the 
City'*. It excels all the other stars in size, and its brilliancy 
is so considerable, that it is the only star which produces a 
shadow by its rays. There has, consequently, been great 
interest made for its name ; some have called it the star of 

among the ancients, where, in speaking of the period of a revolution, both 
the time preceding and that following the interval are included. 

^ The division of the planets into superior and inferior was not known 
to Aristotle, De Mxmdo, cap. ii. p. 602, to Plato, Timseus, p. 318, 319, or 
the older Greek astronomers. It was first made by the Egyptians, and 
was transferred from them to the Romans. It is one of the points in 
which our author differs from Aristotle. See the remarks of Marcus in 
Ajasson, ii. 242 et seq^. Marcus notices the various points which prove 
the deficiency of Pliny's knowledge of astronomy ; he partictdarizes the 
fovir following : — his ignorance of the true situation of the constellations ; 
his erroneous opinion respecting the cause of the seasons ; his account of 
the phases of the moon, and of the position of the cardinal points. He 
appears not to have been aware, that certain astronomical phaenomena 
imdergo a regular progression, but supposed that they remained, at the 
time when he wrote, in the same state as in the age of Hipparchus or 
the original observers. Columella, when treating on these subjects, de- 
scribes the phaenomena according to the ancient calculation, but he informs 
us, that he adopts it, because it was the one in popular use, and better 
known by the farmers (De Re Rust. ix. 14), while Pliny appears not to 
have been aware of the inaccuracy. 

2 " Modo solem antegrediens, mode subsequens." Hardouia in Le- 
maire, ii. 243. 

3 It was not known to the earHer writers that Lucifer and Vesper were 
the same star, differently situated with respect to the Sim. Playfair re- 
marks, that Yenus is the only planet mentioned in the sacred writings, 
and in the most ancient poets, such as Hesiod and Homer ; Outlines, 
ii. 156. 

* There has been much discussion among the commentators respecting 
the correctness of the figures in the text ; according to the sera of the 
olympiads, the date referred to will be between the years 750 and 754 B.C. ; 
the foundation of Rome is commonly referred to the year 753 B.C. See 
the remarks of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 278, 9.

Juno\ others of Isis, and others of the Mother of the Gods. 
By its influence everything in the earth is generated. For, 
as it rises in either direction, it sprinkles everything with 
its genial dew, and not only matures the productions of the 
earth, but stimulates all living things^. It completes the 
circuit of the zodiac in 348 days, never receding from the 
sun more than 46 degrees, according to Timseus^. 

Similarly circumstanced, but by no means equal in size 
and in power, next to it, is the star Mercury, by some called 
Apollo^ ; it is carried in a lower orbit, and moves in a course 
which is quicker by nine days, shining sometimes before the 
rising of the sun, and at other times after its setting, but 
never going farther from it than 23 degrees^, as we learn 
from Timseus and Sosigenes^. The natiu-e of these two stars 
is peculiar, and is not the same with those mentioned above, 
for those are seen to recede from the sun through one-third 
or one-fourth part of the heavens, and are often seen opposite 
to it. They have also other larger circuits, in which they

2 It will be scarcely necessary to refer the reader to the weU-known 
commencement of Lucretius' s poem for the illustration of this passage ; 
it is remarkable that Pliny does not refer to this writer.

greatest elongation is 47° 1' ; SomerviUe, § 641. p. 391.

Stilbon, Mercury, and Apollo ; De Mundo, cap. 2. p. 602 ; see also Apu- 
leius, De Mimdo, § 710. Cicero inverts the order of the planets ; he 
places Mercury next to Mars, and says of Venus, that it is " infima 
quinque eri'antium, terrseque proxima;" De Nat. Deor. ii. 53. Aristotle 
places the stars in the same order, ubi supra, and he is followed in this 
by Apuleius, ubi supra ; this appears to have been the case with the 
Stoics generally ; see Enfield's Phil. i. 339. 

^ For the periodical revolution of Mercury see note ^, p. 27. Its greatest 
elongation, according to Playfau*, p. 160, is 28°. Mrs. SomerviUe, 
p. 386, states it to be 28° 8'. Ptolemy supposed it to be 26*5 degrees ; ; 
Almagest, ix. 7. We learn from Hardouin, Lemaire, i. 246, that there 
is considerable variation in the MSS. with respect to the greatest elonga- 
tion of Mercury.

make their complete revolutions, as will be described in tlie

(9.) But the Moon-, which is the last of the stars, and the 
one the most connected with the earth, the remedy pro\dded 
by nature for darkness, excels all the others in its admirable 
qualities. By the variety of appearances which it assumes, it 
puzzles the observers, mortified that they should be the most 
ignorant concerning that star which is the nearest to them. 
•She is always either waxing or waning ; sometimes her disc 
is curved into horns, sometimes it is divided into two equal 
portions, and at other times it is swelled out into a full orb ; 
sometimes she appears spotted^ and suddenly becomes very 
bright ; she appears very large with her full orb and sud- 
denly becomes invisible ; now continuing during all the night, 
now rising late, and now aiding the light of the sun during 
a part of the day ; becoming eclipsed and yet being visible 
while she is eclipsed ; concealing herself at the end of the 
month and yet not supposed to be eclipsed^. Sometimes 
she is low down, sometimes she is high up, and that not ac- 
cording to one uniform course, being at one time raised up

solis et lunse et quinque eiTantium ad eandem inter se comparationem, 
confectis omnibus spatiis, est facta conversio." De Nat. Deor. ii. 51. 
See the remarks of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 281-3. 

2 For the various appellations which the moon has received in the 
ancient and modern languages, and their relation to each other, the reader 
is referred to the learned remarks of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 283-5. 

^ Marcus conceives that the epithet maculosa does not refer to what 
are called the spots on the moon, but to the circumstance of the edge of 
the disc being not illuminated when it is near the full ; Ajasson, ii. 286. 
But, from the way in which the word is employed at the end of the 
chapter, and from the explanation which is given of the cause of the 
" maculae," I tliink it ought to be referred to the spotted appearance of 
the face of the moon. 

* " Quum laborare non creditiu-." It was a vulgar notion among the 
ancients, that when the moon is ecUpsed, she is sviSering from the influ- 
ence of magicians and enchanters, who are endeavouring to draw her 
down to the earth, in order to aid them in their superstitious ceremonies. 
It was conceived that she might be reheved from her sufferings by loud 
noises of various kinds whicli shovdd drown the songs of the magicians. 
Allusion is frequently made to this custom by the ancient poets, as Virgil, 
^n. i. 742, Manihus, i. 227, and Juvenal, vi. 444 ; and the language has 
been transferred to the modems, as in Beattie's Minstrel, ii. 47, " To 
ease of fancied pangs the labouring moon."

to the heavens, at other times almost contiguous to the 
mountains ; now elevated in the north, now depressed in the 
south ; all which circumstances having been noticed by En- 
dymion, a report was spread about, that he was in love with 
the moon^ We are not indeed sufficiently grateful to those, 
who, with so much labour and care, have enlightened us with 
this light^ ; while, so diseased is the human mind, that we 
take pleasure in writing the annals of blood and slaughter, 
in order that the crimes of men may be made known to those 
who are ignorant of the constitution of the world itself. 

Being nearest fco the axis^, and therefore having the small- 
est orbit, the Moon passes in twenty-seven days and the one- 
third part of a day^, through the same space for which Saturn, 
the highest of the planets, as was stated above, requires thirty 
years. After remaining for two days in conjunction with the 
sun, on the thirtieth day she again very slowly emerges to pur- 
sue her accustomed course^. I know not whether she ought 
not to be considered as our instructress in everything that can 
be known respecting the heavens ; as that the year is divided 
into the twelve divisions of the months, since she follows the 
sun for the same number of times, until he returns to the 
commencement of his course ; and that her brightness, as 
well as that of the other stars, is regulated by that of the 
sun, if indeed they all of them shine by light borrowed from 
him, such as we see floating about, when it is reflected from 
the surface of water. On this account it is that she dissolves 
so much moisture, by a gentle and less perfect force, and 
adds to the quantity of that which the rays of the sun con- 

^ We have some interesting remarks by Marcus respecting Endymion, 
and also on the share which Solon and Thales had in correcting the lunar 
observations ; Ajasson, ii. 288-290.

■* Astronomers describe two different revolutions or periods of the 
moon ; the synodical and the sidereal. The synodical marks the time 
in which the moon passes from one conjunction with the sun to the next 
conjimction, or other similar position with respect to the sun. The side- 
real period is the time in which the moon returns to the same position 
with respect to the stars, or m which it makes a complete revolution roimd 
the earth. These numbers are, for the synodical period, 29^^ 12'' 44™ 2*87*, 
and for the sidereal, 27"^ 7'' 43'" ll-S" ; Herschel, pp. 213, 224.

sume\ On this account she appears with an unequal light, 
because being full only when she is in opposition, on all the 
remaining days she shows only so much of herself to the 
earth as she receives light from the sun^. She is not seen 
in conjunction, because, at that time, she sends back the 
whole stream of light to the source whence she has derived 
it. That the stars generally are nourished by the terrestrial 
moisture is evident, because, when the moon is only half vi- 
sible she is sometimes seen spotted, her power of absorbing 
moisture not ha\dng been powerful enough ; for the spots 
are nothing else than the dregs of the earth drawTi up along 
with the moisture^. (10.) But her eclipses and those of the 
sun, the most wonderful of all the phsenomena of nature, and 
which are like prodigies, serve to indicate the magnitude of 
these bodies and the shadow"* which they cast. 

1 It was a general opinion among the ancients, and one which was en- 
tertained until lately by many of the modems, that the moon possessed 
the power of evaporating the water of the ocean. This opinion appears 
to have been derived, at least in part, from the effect which the moon 
produces on the tides. 

2 "quantum ex sole ipsa concipiat ;" from this passage, taken singly, 
it might be concluded, that the author supposed the quantity of light 
received by the moon to differ at different times ; but the succeeding 
sentence seems to prove that this is not the case ; see the remarks of Alex- 
andre in Lemaire, ii. 249. Marcus, however, takes a different view of the 
subject ; Ajasson, ii. 291, 292. He had previously pointed out Pliny's 
opinion respectmg the phases of the moon, as one of the chcumstances 
which indicate his ignorance of astronomy, ut supra, ii. 245, 246. 

^ This doctrine is maintained by Seneca, Qua?st. Nat. hb. ii. § 5. p. 701, 
702. From the allusion which is made to it by Anacreon, in liis 19th 
ode, we may presimae that it was the current opinion among the ancients. 

^ I may remark, that Poinsinet, in tliis passage, substitutes " umbra " 
for " iunbrseque," contrary to the authority of all the MSS., merely be- 
cause it accords better with his ideas of correct reasoning. Although it

ties are not unfrequently taken, I think it necessary to state my opinion,

CHAP. 7. — OF THE ECLIPSES OE THE MOOTT AND THE SUIT. 

For it is evident that tlie sun is hid by the intervention^ 
of the moon, and the moon by the opposition^ of the earth, 
and that these changes are mutual, the moon, by her inter- 
position\ taking the rays of the sun from the earth, and the 
earth from the moon. As she advances darkness is suddenly 
produced, and again the sun is obscured by her shade ; for 
night is nothing more than the shade of the earth. The 
figure of this shade is like that of a pyramid or an inverted 
top^ ; and the moon enters it only near its point, and it does 
not exceed the height of the moon, for there is no other star 
which is obscured in the same manner, while a figure of this 
kind always terminates in a point. The flight of birds, when 
very lofby, shows that shadows do not extend beyond a certain 
distance ; their limit appears to be the termination of the 
air and the commencement of the aether. Above the moon 
everything is pure and full of an eternal light. The stars 
are visible to us in the night, in the same way that other 
luminous bodies are seen in the dark. It is from these causes 
that the moon is eclipsed during the night^. The two kinds 
of eclipses are not, however, at the stated monthly periods, 
on account of the obliquity of the zodiac, and the irregularly 
wandering course of the moon, as stated above ; besides that 
the motions of these stars do not always occur exactly at the 
same points'*. 

I have seldom if ever perused a translation of any classical author, where, 
on scientific topics, the translator has not endeavoured, more or less, to 
correct the mistakes of the original, and to adapt his translation to the 
state of modem science. 

^ The terms here employed are respectively interventus, objectio, and 
interpositus ; it may be doubted whether the author intended to employ 
them in the precise sense which is indicated by their etymology.

at the two extremities of the spina, or central division of the circus : see 
Montfaucon, v. iii. p. 176 ; Adam, p. 341. 

3 The echpses of the moon are only visible when the spectator is so 
situated as to be able to observe the shadow of the earth, or is on that 
side of the earth which is turned from the sun.

nerally correct account of the principal phaenomena of echpses.

CHAP. 8. (11.) — or THE MAGNITUDE OE THE STAES. 

This kind of reasoning carries the human mind to the 
heavens, and by contemplating the world as it were from 
thence, it discloses to us the magnitude of the three greatest 
bodies in nature \ For the sun could not be entirely con- 
cealed from the earth, by the intervention of the moon, if the 
earth were greater than the moon^. And the vast size of 
the third body, the sun, is manifest from that of the other 
two, so that it is not necessary to scrutinize its size, by argu- 
ing from its visible appearance, or from any conjectures of 
the mind ; it must be immense, because the shadows of rows 
of trees, extending for any number of miles, are disposed in 
right lines^, as if the sun were in the middle of space. Also, 
because, at the equinox, he is vertical to all the inhabitants 
of the southern districts at the same time"* ; also, because 
the shadows of all the people who live on this side of the 
tropic fall, at noon, towards the north, and, at sunrise, point 
to the west. But this could not be the case imless the sun 
were much greater than the earth ; nor, unless it much ex- 
ceeded Mount Ida in breadth, could he be seen when he 
rises, passing considerably beyond it to the right and to the 
left, especially, considering that it is separated by so great 
an intervaP. 

^ Marcus conceives that our author must here mean, not the actual, 
but the apparent size of these bodies ; Ajasson, ii. 295 ; but I do not per- 
ceive that the text authorizes this interpretation. 

2 I have given the simple translation of the original as it now stands 
in the MSS. ; whether these may have been corrupted, or the author 
reasoned incorrectly, I do not venture to decide. The commentators 
have, according to their usual custom, proposed various emendations and 
explanations, for which I may refer to the note of Hardouin in Lemaire, 
ii. 252, with the judicious remarks of Alexandre, and to those of Marcus 
in Ajasson, ii. 295-298, who appear to mo to take a correct view of the 
subject. 

3 Alexandre remarks, "Hinc tamon potius distantia quam magnitude 
SoUs colligi potest." Lemaire, ii. 252. And the same remark applies 
to the two next positions of our author. 

■* Alexandre remarks on the argument of our author, perhaps a httle 
too severely, " Absurde dictum ; nam aliis oritur, ahis occidit, dum aliis 
est a vertice ; quod vel pueri sentiunt." Lemaire, ii. 253. But we may 
suppose, that Phny, in tliis passage, only meant to say, that as the sun 
became vertical to each successive part of the equinoctial district, no 
shadows were formed in it. 

* The commentators have thought it ne&lt;jessary to discuss the question,

36 plikt's natueal history. [Book It 

The eclipse of the moon affords an undoubted argument 
of the sun's magnitude, as it also does of the small size of 
the earths For there are shadows of three figures, and it is 
evident, that if the body which produces the shadow be equal 
to the light, then it will be thrown off in the form of a pillar, 
and have no termination. If the body be greater than the 
light, the shadow ^dll be in the form of an inverted cone^ 
the bottom being the narrowest part, and being, at the sam* 
time, of an infinite length. If the body be less than the 
light, then we shall have the figure of a pyramid^, termina- 
ting in a point. Now of this last kind is the shadow which 
produces the eclipse of the moon, and this is so manifest that 
there can be no doubt remaining, that the earth is exceeded 
in magnitude by the sun, a circumstance which is indeed in- 
dicated by the silent declaration of nature herself. Tor why 
does he recede from us at the winter half of the year"* ? That 
by the darkness of the nights the earth may be refreshed, 
which otherwise would be burned up, as indeed it is in cer- 
tain parts ; so great is his size.

The first among the Romans, who explained to the people 
at large the cause of the two kinds of eclipses, was Sul- 
picius Gallus, w^ho was consul along with Marcellus ; and 

whether, in this passage, Pliny refers to the Ida of Crete or of Asia Minor. 
But the discussion is unnecessary, as the statement of the author is equally 
inappHcable to both of them. Mela appears to refer to tliis opinion in 
the following passage, where he is describing the Ida of Asia Minor ; 

" ipse mens orientem solem ahter quam in aliis terris solet aspici, 

ostentat." hb. i. cap. 18. 

* " Ut dictimi est superiore capite, quo Plinius falso cont^idit Terram 
esse Luna niinorem." Alexandi-e in Lemaire, ii. 253. The words of the 
text, however, apply equally to the comparative size of the earth and the 
sun, as of the earth and the moon. 

2 ." turbo rectus ;" UteraUy an upright top. ^ « meta." 

* This has been pointed out as one of our author's erroneous opinions 
on astronomy. The earth is really about ■j;^^ nearer the sun in our winters 
than in our summers. The greater degree of heat produced by his rays 
in the latter case depends upon their falling on the surface of the earth 
less obliquely. This is the principal cavise of the different temperatures 
of the equatorial and polar refirions.

•vrhen lie was only a military tribune lie relieved tlie army 
from great anxiety the day before king Perseus was con- 
quered by Paidus^ ; for lie Avas brought by the general into 
a public assembly, in order to predict the eclipse, of which 
he afterwards gave an account in a separate treatise. Among 
the Greeks, Thales the Milesian first investigated the sub- 
ject, in the foui'th year of the forty-eighth ol}Tnpiad, pre- 
dicting the eclipse of the sun which took place in the reign 
of Alyattes, in the 170th year of the City^ After them Hip- 
parchus calculated the course of both these stars for the term 
of 600 years^, including the months, days, and hours, the 
situation of the different places and the aspects adapted to 
each of them ; all this has been confirmed by experience, 
and could only be acquired by partaking, as it were, in the 
councils of nature. These were indeed great men, superior 
to ordinary mortals, who having discovered the laws of these 
divine bodies, relieved the miserable mind of man from the 
fear which he had of eclipses, as foretelling some dreadful

of this transaction in Livy, xliv. 37, and in Plutarch, Life of Paulus 
^milius, Langhome's trans, ii. 279 ; he however does not mention the 
name of Gallus. See also Yal. Maximus, viii. 11. 1, and Quintihan, i. 
10. Yal. Maximus does not say that Gallus predicted the ecUpse, but 
explained the cause of it when it had occm'red ; and the same statement 
is made by Cicero, De Eepub. i. 15. For an account of Sulpicius, see 
Hardouin's Index auctorum, Lemaire, i. 214. 

2 An accovmt of tliis event is given by Herodotus, CHo, § 74. There 
has been the same kind of discussion among the commentators, respect- 
ing the dates in the text, as was noticed above, note ^, p. 29 : see the 
remarks of Brotier and of Marcus in Lemaire and Ajasson, in loco. As- 
tronomers have calculated that the echpse took place May 28th, 585 B.C. ; 
Brewster, ut supra, pp. 414, 419. 

■* Hipparchus is generally regarded as the first astronomer who pro- 
secuted the science in a regular and systematic manner. See "Wliewell, 
C. 3. p. 169 et seq., 177-179. He is supposed to have made his observa- 
tions between the years 160 and 125 B.C. He made a catalogue of the 
fixed stars, which is preserved in Ptolemy's Magn. Const. The only 
work of his now extant is his commentary on Aratus ; it is contained in 
Petau's Uranologie. We find, among the ancients, many traces of their 
acquaintance with the period of 600 years, or what is termed the great 
year, when the solar and lunar phsenomena recur precisely at the same 
points. Cassini, Mem. Acad., and Bailly, Hist. Anc. Astron., have shown 
that there is an actual fovmdation for this opinion. See the remarks of

acknowledged in the sublime strains of Stesichorus and Pin- 
dar, as being produced by an eclipse of the sun\ And with 
respect to the eclipse of the moon, mortals impute it to 
witchcraft, and therefore endeavour to aid her by producing 
discordant sounds. In consequence of this kind of terror it 
was that Nicias, the general of the Athenians, being ignorant 
of the cause, was afraid to lead out the fleet, and brought 
great distress on his troops^. Hail to your genius, ye in-

in a brief and summary manner, touch on those points in 
which we are agreed, giving the reasons where it is necessary 
to do so ; for this is not a work of profound argument, nor 
is it less wonderful to be able to suggest a probable cause for 
everything, than to give a complete account of a few of 
them only.

It is ascertained that the eclipses complete their whole 
revolution in the space of 223 months^, that the eclipse 
of the sun takes place only at the conclusion or the com- 
mencement of a lunation, which is termed conjimction^, 

* Seneca, the tragedian, refers to this superstitious opinion in some 
beautiful verses, which are given to the chorus at the termination of the 
fourth act of the Thyestes.

wMe an eclipse of the moon takes place only when she is 
at the full, and is always a little farther advanced than the 
preceding eclipsed Now there are eclipses of both these 
stars in every year, which take place below the^ earth, at 
stated days and hours ; and when they are above it^ they are 
not always ^dsible, sometimes on account of the clouds, but 
more frequently, from the globe of the earth being opposed 
to the vault of the heavens^ It was discovered two hundred 
years ago, by the sagacity of Hipparchus, that the moon is 
sometimes eclipsed after an interval of five months, and the 
sun after an interval of seven^ ; also, that he becomes invi- 
sible, wliile above the horizon, t^dce in every thirty days, 
but that this is seen in different places at different times. 
But the most wonderful circumstance is, that while it is ad- 
mitted that the moon is darkened by the shadow of the earth, 
this occurs at one time on its western, and at another time 
on its eastern side. And farther, that although, after the 
rising of the sun, that darkening shadow ought to be below 
the earth, yet it has once happened, that the moon has been 
eclipsed in the west, while both the luminaries have been above 
the horizon^ And as to their both being invisible in the 
space of fifteen days, this very thing happened while the 
Vespasians were emperors, the father being consul for the 
third time, and the son for the second^ 

1 " Hoc enim periodo (223 mensium) plerumque redeunt eclipses, non 
multiun differentes, denis tamen gradibus zodiaci antecedentes ;" Kepler, 
as quoted by Alexandi-e, in Lemaire, ii. 238. 

2 The terms " sub terra" and " supeme" are interpreted, by most ot the 
commentators, below and above the horizon respectively ; see Marcus m 
Aiasson, ii. 307. „ _ 

3 " globo ten-ffi obstante convexitatibus mundi." The term convexus, 
as apphed to the heavens, or visible firmament, simply signifies arched j 
not opposed to cotwave, hke the Enghsh word convex.

power of the atmosphere, causing the sun to be visible above the horizon,

CHAP. 11. (14.) — OF THE MOTION" OP THE MOON. 

It is certain tliat tlie moon, having lier horns always turned 
from the sun, when she is waxing, looks towards the east ; 
when she is waning, towards the west. Also, that, from the 
second day after the change, she adds 47|- minutes^ each day, 
until she is full, and again decreases at the same rate, and 
that she always becomes invisible when she is within 14 de- 
grees of the sun. This is an argument of the greater size of 
the planets than of the moon, since these emerge when they 
are at the distance of 7 degrees only^. But their altitude 
causes them to appear much smaller, as we observe that, 
during the day, the brightness of the sun prevents those 
bodies from being seen which are fixed in the firmament, 
although they shine then as well as in the night : that this 
is the case is proved by eclipses, and by descending into very 
deep wells. 

CHAP. 12. (15.) — OP THE MOTIONS OP THE PLANETS AND 
THE GENEEAL LAWS OP TEEIE ASPECTS^. 

The three planets, which, as we have said, are situated 
above the sun^, are visible when they come into conjunction 
with him. They rise visibly^ in the morning, when they are 
not more than 11 degrees from the sun^ ; they are afterwards 
directed by the contact of his rays-^, and when they attain 
the trine aspect, at the distance of 120 degrees, they take 
their morning stationary positions^, which are termed pri- 

^ In a subsequent part of the work, xviii. 75, the author gives a dif- 
ferent rate of increase, viz. 51^ minutes ; neither of these nmnbers is 
correct ; the mean rate of increase being, according to Alexandre, about 
54' or 55' ; Lemaire, ii. 261, 262. See also Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 311-14. 

2 It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the effect, as here stated, has 
no connexion with the supposed cause.

remarks of Alexandre, iia Lemaire, ii. 263. 

7 "radiorum ejus contactu reguntur." The doctrine of the ancient 
astronomers was, that the motions of the planets are always governed by 
the rays of the sun, according to its position, attracting or repeUing them.

point of the zodiac, when it is so situated with respect to the earth, that

niary ; afterwards, when they are in opposition to the sim, they 
rise at the distance of 180 degrees from him. And again ad- 
vancing on the other side to the 120th degree, they attain their 
evening stations, which are termed secondary, until the sun 
ha^dng arrived within 12 degrees of them, what is called their 
evening setting becomes no longer visible ^ Mars, as being 
nearer to the sun, feels the influence of his rays in the quadra- 
ture,at the distance of 90 degrees, whence that motion receives 
its name, being termed, from the two risings, respectively the 
first and the second nonagenarian^. This planet passes from 
one station to another in six months, or is two months in each 
sign ; the two other planets do not spend more than four 
months in passing from station to station. 

The two inferior planets are, in like manner, concealed in 
their evening conjimction, and, when they have left the sun, 
they rise in the morning the same number of degrees distant 
from him. After having arrived at their point of greatest 
elongation^, they then follow the sim, and having overtaken 

a straight hne passmg through the two bodies forms a tangent to the 
smaller orbit. The apparent motion of the planets, sometimes dii'ect and at 
other times retrograde, with their stationary positions, is occasioned by the 
eartli and the planets moving in concentric orbits, -with diiferent velo- 
cities. One hmidi-ed and twenty degi'ees is the mean distance at wliich 
the three superior planets become stationary. We have an elaborate 
dissertation by Marcvis, on the unequal velocities of the planets, and on 
their stations and retrogi-adations, as weU according to the system of 
Ai'istotle as to that of Coperaicus ; Ajasson, ii. 316 et seq. He remarks,

among the commentators and translators ; I may refer the reader to the 
remarks of Poinsinet, i. 70, 71 ; of Alexandre in Lemaire, ii. 266 ; and 
of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 328. I conceive the meaning of the author to be, 
that while the otherplanets become stationary, when at 120 degi'ees fi'om the 
sun, Mars becomes so at 90 degrees, being detained by the rays, wliich act 
upon him more powerfully, m consequence of his being nearer to their 
source.

him at their morning setting, they become invisible and pass 
beyond him. They then rise in the evening, at the distances 
which were mentioned above. After this they return back 
to the sun and are concealed in their evening setting. The 
star Venus becomes stationary when at its two points of 
greatest elongation, that of the morning and of the eveniug, 
according to their respective risings. The stationary points 
of Mercury are so very brief, that they cannot be correctly 
observed. 

CHAP. 13. — WHY THE SAME STAES APPEAE AT SOME TIMES 
MOEE LOPTY AND AT OTHEE TIMES MOEE NEAE. 

The above is an account of the aspects and the occultations 
of the planets, a subject which is rendered very complicated 
by their motions, and is involved in much that is wonderful ; 
especially, when we observe that they change their size and 
coloiu*, and that the same stars at one time approach the 
north, and then go to the south, and are now seen near the 
earth, and then suddenly approach the heavens. If on this 
subject I deliver opinions different from my predecessors, I 
acknowledge that I am indebted for them to those indivi- 
duals who first pointed out to us the proper mode of inquiry; 
let no one then ever despair of benefiting future ages. 

But these things depend upon many different causes. The 
first cause is the nature of the circles described by the stars, 
which the Grreeks term a-psides^, for we are obliged to use 
Grreek terms, Now each of the planets has its own circle, 
and this a different one from that of the world^ ; because the 
earth is placed in the centre of the heavens, with respect to 
the two extremities, which are called the poles, and also in 

fi'om the Sim at wliich Yentis and Mercury become stationary, and when 
they attain theu' greatest elongations ; Ajasson, ii. 328, 329. According 
to Ptolemy, Magn. Constr. hb. viii. cap. 7, the evening setting of Yenus 
is at 5° 40' fi-om the sun, and that of Mercmy at 11° 30'. 

^ " ' Ai//js, hgneus rotse ch'culus, ab utttu) necto;" Hederic in loco. The 
term is employed in a somewhat different sense by the modem astrono- 
mers, to signify the point in the orbit of a planet, when it is either at the 
greatest or the least distance from the earth, or the body about which it 
revolves ; the former being tei'med the apogee, aphehon, or the higher 
apsis ; the latter the perigee, perhelion, or lower apsis ; Jennings on the 
Globes, pp. 64, 65.

that of the zodiac, which is situated obliquely between them. 
And all these things are made evident by the infallible results 
which we obtain by the use of the compasses \ Hence the 
apsides of the planets have each of them different centres, and 
consequently they have different orbits and motions, since it 
necessarily follows, that the interior apsides are the shortest. 

(16.) The apsides which are the highest from the centre 
of the earth are, for Saturn, when he is in Scorpio, for Jupiter 
in Yirgo, for Mars in Leo, for the Sun in Gemini, for Venus 
in Sagittarius, and for Mercury in Capricorn, each of them 
in the middle of these signs ; while in the opposite signs, 
they are the lowest and nearest to the centre of the earth". 
Hence it is that they appear to move more slowly when 
they are carried along the highest circuit ; not that their 
actual motions are accelerated or retarded, these being fixed 
and determinate for each of them ; but because it necessarily 
follows, that lines drawn from the highest apsis must approach 
nearer to each other at the centre, like the spokes of a wheel ; 
and that the same motion seems to be at one time greater, 
and at another time less, according to the distance from the 
centre. 

Another cause of the altitudes of the planets is, that their 
highest apsides, with relation to their own centres, are in 
different signs from those mentioned above^ Saturn is in 
the 20th degree of Libra, Jupiter in the 15th of Cancer, 
Mars in the 28th of Capricorn, the Sun in the 19th of Aries, 
Yenus in the 27th of Pisces, Mercury in the 15th of Yirgo, 
and the Moon in the 3rd of Taurus. 

The third cause of the altitude depends on the form of the 
heavens, not on that of the orbits ; the stars appearing to 
the eye to mount up and to descend through the depth of 
the air^ AYith this cause is connected that which depends 

^ "ratione circini semper indubitata." 

2 In consequence of the precession of the equinoxes these points are 
continually advancing from W. to E., and are now about 30 degrees from 
the situation they were in when the observations were first made by 
the modem astronomers. 

3 Our author here probably refers to the motions of the planets through 
their epicycles or secondary cii'cles, the centres of which were supposed 
to be in the peripheries of the primary circles. See Alexandi-e m Lo-

It is through this belt that the stars which I have spoken of 
are carried, nor is there any part of the world habitable, ex- 
cept what lies under it^ ; the remainder, which is at the poles, 
being in a wild desert state. The planet Venus alone exceeds 
it by 2 degrees, which we may suppose to be the cause why 
some animals are produced even in these desert regions of 
the earth. The moon also wanders the whole breadth of the 
zodiac, but never exceeds it. Next to these the planet Mer- 
cury moves through the greatest space ; yet out of the 12 de- 
grees (for there are so many degrees of latitude in the zodiac^), 
it does not pass through more than 8, nor does it go equally 
tlfrough these, 2 of them being in the middle of the zodiac, 
4 in the upper part, and 2 in the lower part^. Next to these 
the Sun is carried through the middle of the zodiac, winding 
unequally through the two parts of his tortuous circuit^. 
The star Mars occupies the four middle degrees ; Jupiter 
the middle degree and the two above it ; Saturn, like the 

refers iii the stoiy of Phaeton, where he is describing the daily path of 
the sun ; Metam, ii. 63-67. 

1 " quam quod illi subjacet ;" under this designation the author obvi- 
ously meant to include the temperate zones, although it technically ap- 
plies only to the part between the tropics. It is scarcely necessary to 
remark, that modern discoveries have shown that this opinion respecting 
the Arctic zone is not strictly correct. 

2 The breadth of the zodiac, which was limited by the ancients to 12 
degrees, has been extended by the modern astronomers to 18, and wotdd 
require to be much farther extended to include the newly discovered 
planet. Herschel's Astronomy, § 254. 

3 There is considerable difficulty in ascertaining the meaning of the 
terms employed by our author in describing the coiu'se of the planet 
Mercury tln-ough the zodiac; "medio ejus," "supra," and "infra." 
Hardouin's comment is as follows: "Duas zodiaci partes sen gradus 
pererrat, quum ipse per medium incedit signiferum : supra, quum deflectit 
ad Aquilonem, per quatuor ahas ejusdem partes vagatur : infra, quum 
descendit ad Austrimi, discedit duabus." Lemaire, ii. 271, 272. But 
Marcus has shown that the opinion of Hardoxiin is inadmissible and in- 
consistent with the facts ; Ajasson, ii. 338-341. He proposes one, which 
be conceives to be more correct, but we may probably be led to the con- 
clusion, that the imperfect knowledge and incorrect opinions of our au- 
thor on these subjects must render it impossible to afford an adequate 
explanation.

sun, occupies two^ The above is an account of the lati- 
tudes as they descend to the south or ascend to the norths 
Hence it is plain that the generality of persons are mistaken 
m supposing the third cause of the apparent altitude to 
depend on the stars rising from the earth and climbing up 
the heavens. But to refute this opinion it is necessary to 
consider the subject with very great minuteness, and to 
embrace all the causes. 

It is generally admitted, that the stars^ at the time of 
their evening setting, are nearest to the earth, both \\dth 
respect to latitude and altitude^ that they are at the com- 
mencement of both at their morning risings, and that they 
become stationary at the middle points of their latitudes, 
jvhat are called the ecliptics ^ It is, moreover, acknow- 
ledged, that their motion is increased when they are in the 
ncinity of the earth, and diminished when they are removed 
to a greater altitude^ ; a point which is most clearly proved 
by the different altitudes of the moon. There is no doubt 
that it is also increased at the morning risings^ and that the 
three superior planets are retarded, as they advance from 
the first station to the second. And since this is the case, it

tence respecting the sun, we may suspect some error in the text j see 
Poinsinet, Alexandre, and Marcus, in loco.

geocentric latitudes of the planets, as assigned by Pliny, and as laid down 
by the modems. Lemaire, ii. 273 : —

3 It appears from the remark at the end of this chapter, that this ex- 
planation appHes to the superior planets alone. 

■* It is not easy, as Marcus observes, Ajasson, ii. 344, 345, to compre- 
hend the exact meaning of this passage, or to reconcile it with the other 
parts of our author's theory.

is evident, that tlie latitudes are increased from tlie time of 
their morning risings, since the motions afterwards appear 
to receive less addition ; hut they gain their altitude in the 
first station, since the rate of their motion then hegins to 
diminish \ and the stars to recede. 

And the reason of this must he particularly set forth. 
When the planets are struck hy the rays of the sun, in the 
situation which I have described, i. e. in their quadrature, 
they are prevented from holding on their straight forward 
course, and are raised on high hy the force of the fire^ This 
cannot he immediately perceived hy the eye, and therefore 
they seem to he stationary, and hence the term station is 
derived. Afterwards the violence of the rays increases, and 
the vapour being beaten back forces them to recede. 

This exists in a greater degree in their evening risings, the 
sun being then turned entirely from them, when they are 
drawn into the highest apsides ; and they are then the least 
visible, since they are at their greatest altitude ^ and are 
carried along with the least motion, as much less indeed as 
this takes place in the highest signs of the apsides. At the 
time of the evening rising the latitude decreases and becomes 
less as the motion is diminished, and it does not increase 
again until they arrive at the second station, when the alti- 
tude is also diminished ; the sun's rays then coming from 
the other side, the same force now therefore propels them 
towards the earth which before raised them into the heavens, 
from their former triangular aspect^ So different is the 
effect whether the rays strike the planets from below or 
come to them from above. And all these circumstances 
produce much more effect when they occur in the evening 
setting. This is tlie doctrine of the superior planets ; that

andre, " numerus nempe partium quas certo temporis intervallo emeti-

par-Ik que les phenomenes celestes qm sont contemporains sont engendres

2 The hypothesis of Phny appears to be, that the planets are affected 
by the rays of the sun, and that according to the angle at which they 
receive the impulse, they are either accelerated or retarded in their 
course. ^ " ex priore triquetro."

by any one before nie\ 

CHAP. 14. (17.) — WHY THE SAME STAES HATE DITFEEEXT 

MOTIONS. 

I must first state the cause, why the star Yenus never 
recedes from the sun more than 46 degrees, nor Mercury more 
than 23^, while they frequently return to the sun within this 
distance^. As they are situated below the sun, they have 
both of them their apsides turned in the contrary direction ; 
their orbits are as much below the earth as those of the 
stars above mentioned are above it, and therefore they cannot 
recede any farther, since the curve of their apsides has no 
greater longitude^ The extreme parts of their apsides 
therefore assign the limits to each of them in the same 
manner, and compensate, as it were, for the small extent of 
their longitudes, by the great divergence of their latitudes^. 
It may be asked, wliy do they not always proceed as far as 
the 46th and the 23rd degrees respectively ? They in reality 
do so, but the theory fails us here. Por it would appear 
that the apsides are themselves moved, as they never pass 
over the sun^. When therefore they have arrived at the 

^ Alexandre supposes, as I conceive justly, that our author, in this 
passage, only refers to the writings of his own countrymen ; Lemaire, ii. 
276. 

2 According to Ptolemy, these numbers are respectively 47° 51' and 
24° 3' ; the modem astronomers have ascertained them to be 48° and 29°. 
The least elongations of the planets are, according to Ptolemy, 44° 7' and 
18° 50', and according to the observations of the modems, 45° and 16° j 
Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 354. 

3 I have not translated the clause, " quum sint divers® stellae," as, 
according to Hardouin, it is not found " in probatissimis codd.," and 
appears to have Httle connexion with the other parts of the sentence ; 
it is omitted by Yalpy and Lemau'c, but is retained by PoLasinet and 
Ajasson. 

4 When these inferior planets have arrived at a certain apparent 
distance from the sun, they are come to tho extent of their orbits, as seen 
from the earth. 

5 " Quum ad iUam Sobs distantiam pervencrunt, ultra procedere non 
possunt, deficicnte circuh longitudine, id est, amphtuduie." Alexandre in

extremities of their orbits on either side, tlie stars are then 
supposed to have proceeded to their greatest distance ; when 
they have been a certain number of degrees within their 
orbits, they are then supposed to return more rapidly, since 
the extreme point in each is the same. And on this account 
it is that the direction of their motion appears to be changed. 
For the superior planets are carried along the most quickly 
in their eveniug setting, while these move the most slowly ; 
the former are at their greatest distance from the earth 
when they move the most slowly, the latter when they move 
the most quickly. The former are accelerated when nearest 
to the earth, the latter when at the extremity of the circle ; 
in the former the rapidity of the motion begins to 
diminish at their morning risings, in the latter it begins to 
increase ; the former are retrograde from their morning to 
their evening station, while Venus is retrograde from the 
evening to the morning station. She begins to increase her 
latitude from her morning rising, her altitude follows the 
sun from her morning station, her motion being the quickest 
and her altitude the greatest in her morning setting. Her 
latitude decreases and her altitude diminishes from her 
evening rising, she becomes retrograde, and at the same 
time decreases in her altitude from her evening station. 

Again, the star Mercury, in the same way, mounts up in 
both directions^ from his morning rising, and having followed 
the sun through a space of 15 degrees, he becomes almost sta- 
tionary for four days. Presently he diminishes his altitude, 
and recedes from his evening setting to his morning rising. 
Mercury and the Moon are the only planets which descend 
for the same number of days that they ascend. Venus 
ascends for fifteen days and somewhat more; Saturn and 
Jupiter descend in twice that number of days, and Mars in 
four times. So great is the variety of nature ! The reason 
of it is, however, evident ; for those planets which are forced 
up by the vapour of the sun likewise descend with difficulty.

■^ell as the laws to which they are subject, which might be 
mentioned. For example, the planet Mars, whose course is 
the most difficult to observe \ n^ver becomes stationary when 
Jupiter is in the trine aspect, very rarely when he is 60 degrees 
from the sun, which number is one-sixth of the circuit of the 
heavens" ; nor does he ever rise in the same sign vsdth Jupiter, 
except in Cancer and Leo. The star Mercury seldom has 
his evening risings in Pisces, but very frequently in Yirgo, 
and his morning risings in Libra ; he has also his morning 
rising in Aquarius, very rarely in Leo. He never becomes 
retrograde either in Taurus or in Gemini, nor imtil the 25th 
degree of Cancer. The Moon makes her double conjunction 
with the sun in no other sign except Gemini, while Sagit- 
tarius is the only sign in which she has sometimes no con- 
junction at all. The old and the new moon are visible on 
the same day or night in no other sign except Aries, and 
indeed it has happened very seldom to any one to have wit- 
nessed it. From this circumstance it was that the tale of 
Lynceus's quick-sightedness originated^ , Saturn and Mars 
are invisible at most for 170 days ; Jupiter for 36, or, at the 
least, for 10 days less than this ; Venus for 69, or, at the least, 
for 52 ; Mercury for 13, or, at the most, for IS"*.

The difference of their colour depends on the difference in 
their altitudes ; for they acquire a resemblance to those planets 
into the vapour of which they are carried, the orbit of each 
tinging those that approach it in each direction. A colder 
planet renders one that approaches it paler, one more hot

■* The relative situation of these astronomical phsenomena has changed 
since the time of Pliny, in consequence of the precession of the equinoxes.

renders it redder, a windj planet gives it a lowering aspect, 
while the sun, at the union of their apsides, or the extremity 
of their orbits, completely obscures them. Each of the 
planets has its peculiar colour^; Saturn is white, Jupiter 
brilliant. Mars fiery, Lucifer is glowing, Yesper refulgent, 
Mercury sparkling, the Moon mild ; the Sun, when he rises, 
is blazing, afterwards he becomes radiating. The appearance 
of the stars, which are fixed in the firmament, is also affected 
by these causes. At one time we see a dense cluster of stars 
around the moon, when she is only half-enlightened, and 
when they are viewed in a serene evening ; while, at another 
time, when the moon is full, there are so few to be seen, that 
we wonder whither they are fled; and this is also the case when 
the rays of the sim, or of any of the above-mentioned bodies^, 
have dazzled our sight. And, indeed, the moon herself is, 
without doubt, differently affected at different times by the 
rays of the sun ; when she is entering them, the convexity 
of the heavens^ rendering them more feeble than when they 
fall upon her more directly'*. Hence, when she is at a right 
angle to the sun, she is half-enlightened ; when in the trine 
aspect, she presents an imperfect orb^, while, in opposition, 
she is full. Again, when she is waning, she goes through 
the same gradations, and in the same order, as the three stars 
that are superior to the sun^.

employs to explain the different phases of the moon betrays his ignorance,

principles which affect f;he appearance of the heavenly bodies.

is equal to the day, in the Spring and in the Autumn, 
when he is opposed to the centre of the earth \ in the 8th 
degree of Aries and Libra^. The length of the day and the 
niglit is then twice changed, when the day increases in length, 
from the winter solstice in the 8th degree of Capricorn, and 
afterwards, when tlie night increases in length from the 
summer solstice in the 8th degree of Cancer^. The cause of 
this inequality is the obliquity of the zodiac, since there is, 
at every moment of time, an equal portion of the firmament 
above and below the horizon. But the signs which mount 
directly upwards, when they rise, retain the light for a longer 
space, while those that are more oblique pass along more 
quickly. 

CHAP. 18. (20.) — WHY THTJJiTDEE IS ASCEIBED TO JXJPITEE. 

It is not generally known, what has been discovered by 
men who are the most eminent for their learning, in con- 
sequence of their assiduous observations of the heavens, that 
the fires which fall upon the earth, and receive the name of 
thunder-bolts, proceed from the three superior stars'*, but 
principally from the one which is situated in the middle. It 
may perhaps depend on the superabundance of moisture from 
the superior orbit communicating with the heat from the 
inferior, which are expelled in this manner^ ; and hence it 
is commonly said, the thunder-bolts are darted by Jupiter. 
And as, in burning wood, the burnt part is cast off" with a 
crackling noise, so does the star throw ofi" this celestial fire, 
bearing the omens of future events, even the part which is 

^ " centrum ten'se ; " the equator, the part equally distant from the 
two poles or extremities. 

^ It may be remarked, that the equinoxes did not actually take place 
at this period in the pomts mentioned by Phny, but in the 28th deojrees 
of Pisces and Yirgo respectively ; he appears to have conformed to the 
popular opinion, as we may learn from Columella, Hb. ix. cap. 14. The 
degrees mentioned above were those fixed by the Greek astronomers who 
formed the celestial sphere, and wliicli Avas about 138 years before the 
Christian ara. See the remarks of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 246 &amp; 373, 374. 

3 The same remark apphes to this as to the former observation. 

* " siderum." 

° The hypothesis of the author is, that the excess of moisture in the 
orbit of Saturn, and the excess of heat in that of Mars, unite in the orbit 
of Jupiter and are discharged in the form of thunder.

thrown off not losing its divine operation. And this takes 
place more particularly when the air is in an unsettled state, 
either because the moisture which is then collected excites 
the greatest quantity of fire, or because the air is disturbed, 
as if by the parturition of the pregnant star. 

CHAP. 19. (21.) — OP THE niSTAITCES OF THE STAES. 

Many persons have attempted to discover the distance of 
thie stars from the earth, and they have published as the 
result, that the sun is nineteen times as far from the moon, 
as the moon herself is from the earth\ Pythagoras, who 
was a man of a very sagacious mind, computed the distance 
from the earth to the moon to be 126,000 furlongs, that 
from her to the sun is double this distance, and that it is 
three times this distance to the twelve signs ^ ; and this was 
also the opinion of our countryman, Gallus Sulpicius^. 

CHAP. 20. (22.) — OP THE HAEMOirr OP THE STAES. 

Pythagoras, employing the terms that are used in music, 
sometimes names the distance between the Earth and the 
Moon a tone ; from her to Mercury he supposes to be half 
this space, and about the same from liim to Venus. Erom 
her to the Sun is a tone and a half; from the Sun to Mars is 
a tone, the same as from the Earth to the Moon ; from him 
there is half a tone to Jupiter, from Jupiter to Saturn also 

1 Alexandre remarks, tliat Pliny mentions tliis, not as his own opinion, 
but that of many persons ; for, in chap. 21, he attempts to prove mathe- 
matically, that the moon is situated at an equal distance between the sim. 
and the earth ; Lemaire, ii. 286. 

2 Marcus remarks upon the inconsistency between the account here 
given of Pythagoras' s opinion, and what is generally supposed to have 
been his theory of the planetary system, according to which the sun, and 
not the earth, is placed ia the centre ; Enfield's Philosophy, i. 288, 289. 
Yet we find that Plato, and many others among the ancients, give us the 
same accotmt of Pythagoras's doctrine of the respective distances of the 
heavenly bodies; Ajasson, ii. 374. Plato in his Timseus, 9. p. 312-315, 
details the comphcated arrangement which he supposes to constitute the 
proportionate distances of the planetary bodies. 

3 Sulpicius has abeady been mentioned, in the ninth chapter of this 
book, as being the first among the Eomans who gave a popular explana- 
tion of the cause of ecUpses.

half a tone, and thence a tone and a half to the zodiac. 
Hence there are seven tones, which he terms the diapason 
harmony \ meaning the whole compass of the notes. In 
this, Saturn is said to move in the Doric time, Jupiter in the 
Phrygian-, and so forth of the rest ; but this is a refinement 
rather amusing than useful.

The stadium is equal to 125 of our Eoman paces, or 625 feet^. 
Posidonius'* supposes that there is a space of not less than 
40 stadia around the earth, whence mists °, winds and clouds^ 
proceed ; beyond this he supposes that the air is pure and 
liquid, consisting of uninterrupted light ; from the clouded 
region to the moon there \b a space of 2,000,000 of stadia,

Lemarre, ii. 287. 

2 These appellatioris appear to have originated from different nations 
having assumed different notes as the foundation or commencement of 
their musical scale. The Abbe Barthelemi informs us, that " the Dorians 
executed the same air a tone lower than the Phrygians, and the latter a 
tone still higher than the Lydians ; hence the denomination of the Dorian, 
Phrygian, and Lydian modes." It appears to have been a general prac- 
tice to employ the lowest modes for the slowest airs j Anacharsis's Travels, 
iii. 73, 74. 

3 Hence the passus will be equal to 5 Roman feet. If we estimate 
the Roman foot at 11*6496 EngUsh inches, we shall have the miliare of 
8 stadia equal to 1618 EngHsh yards, or 142 yards less than an EngHsh 
statute mole. See Adam's Roman Antiquities, p. 503 ; also the articles 
Mihare and Pes in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities ; 
and for the varieties of the stadium, as employed at different periods and 
in different countries, see the article Stadium. The stadium which He- 
rodotus employed in measurements of Babylon has been supposed to 
consist of 490 Enghsh feet, while that of Xenophon and Strabo has been 
estimated at 505 ; see Ed. Rev. xlviii. 190. The Abbe Barthelemi sup- 
poses the stadium to be equal to 604 EngHsh feet ; Anach. Travels, vii. 284. 

^ There appears to have been two individuals of this name, who have 
been confounded with each other ; the one referred to by Pliny was an 
astronomer of Alexandria, who flomished about 260 years B.C. ; the other

turies later ; see Aikin's Biog. in loco ; also Hardouin's Index Auctorum,

and tlience to the sun of 500,000,000 ^ It is in consequence 
of this space that the sun, notwithstanding his immense 
magnitude, does not burn the earth. Many persons have 
imagined that the clouds rise to the height of 900 stadia. 
These points are not completely made out, and are dif&amp;cult 
to explain ; but we have given the best account of them that 
has been published, and if we may be allowed, in any degree, 
to pursue these investigations, there is one infallible geome- 
trical principle, which we cannot reject. Not that we can 
ascertain the exact dimensions (for to profess to do this 
would be almost the act of a madman), but that the mind 
may have some estimate to direct its conjectures. Now it is 
evident that the orbit through which the sun passes consists 
of nearly 366 degrees, and that the diameter is always the third 
part and a little less than the seventh of the circumference^. 
Then taking the half of this (for the earth is placed in the 
centre) it will follow, that nearly one-sixth part of the im- 
mense space, which the mind conceives as constituting the 
orbit of the sun round the earth, will compose his altitude. 
That of the moon will be one-twelfth part, since her course 
is so much shorter than that of the sun ; she is therefore 
carried along midway between the sun and the earth^. It 
is astonishing to what an extent the weakness of the mind 
will proceed, urged on by a little success, as in the above- 
mentioned instance, to give full scope to its impudence ! 
Thus, having ventured to guess at the space between the sun 
and the earth, we do the same with respect to the heavens, 
because he is situated midway between them ; so that we may 
come to know the measure of the whole world in inches. 
Por if the diameter consist of seven parts, there will be 
twenty-two of the same parts in the circumference ; as if we 
could measure the heavens by a plumb-line ! 

The Egyptian calculation, which was made out by Petosi-

ference as 1 to 3"1416 ; Hutton's Diet, in loco. Ptolemy states it to be 
precisely as 1 to 3 ; Magn. Const, i. 12. 

* The author's reasoning is foimded upon the supposition of the length 
of the sun's path round the earth being twelve times greater than that 
of the moon's ; the orbit therefore would be twelve times greater and the 
radius in the same proportion.

ris and Necepsos, supposes tliat each degree of the lunar 
orbit (which, as I have said, is the least) consists of little 
more than 33 stadia ; in the very large orbit of Saturn the 
number is double ; in that of the sun, which, as we have 
said, is in the middle \ we have the half of the sum of these 
numbers. And this is indeed a very modest calculation^, 
since if we add to the orbit of Saturn the distance from him 
to the zodiac, we shall have an infinite number of degrees^

A few things still remain to be said concerning the world ; 
for stars are suddenly formed in the heavens themselves ; of 
these there are various kinds. 

(25.) The Greeks name these stars comets^ ; we name them 
CrinitsD, as if shaggy with bloody locks, and surrounded with 
bristles like hair. Those stars, which have a mane hanging 
do\\ni from their lower part, like a long beard, are named 
Pogoniae^ Those that are named AcontisB^ vibrate like a dart 
with a very quick motion. It w^as one of this kind which the 
Emperor Titus described in his very excellent poem, as 
ha\TQg been seen in his fifth consulship ; and this was the 
last of these bodies which has been observed. AVhen they 
are short and pointed they are named Xiphiae^ ; these are the

opinions of Ai-istotle respecting comets and meteors of all kinds, while he 
pays but httle attention to those of his contemporary Seneca, wliich how- 
ever, on some points, would appear to be more corx'cct. See the remarks 
of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 244. Under the title of comets he includes, not 
only those bodies which are permanent and move in regular orbits, but 
such as are transient, and are produced from various causes, the natui'e of 
which is not weU understood. See Aristotle, Meteor, hb. i. cap. 6, 7,

pale kind ; they sTiine like a sword and are without any rays ; 
while we name those Discei\ which, being of an amber colour, 
in conformity with their name, emit a few rays from their 
margin only. A kind named Pitheus^ exhibits the figure of 
a cask, appearing convex and emitting a smoky light. The 
kmd named Cerastias^ has the appearance of a horn ; it is 
like the one which was visible when the Greeks fought at 
Salamis. Lampadias"* is like a burning torch ; Hippias^ is 
like a horse's mane ; it has a very rapid motion, like a circle 
revolving on itself. There is also a white comet, with silver 
hair, so brilliant that it can scarcely be looked at, exhibiting, 
as it were, the aspect of the Deity in a human form. There 
are some also that are shaggy, having the appearance of a 
fleece, surrounded by a kind of crown. There was one, 
where the appearance of a mane was changed into that of a 
spear ; it happened in the 109th olympiad, in the 398th year 
of the City^. The shortest time during which any one of 
them has been observed to be visible is 7 days, the longest 
180 days.

generally in that white part of it which has ohtained the 
name of the INIilky Way. Aristotle informs us that several 
of them are to be seen at the same time\ but this, as far as 
I know, has not been observed by any one else ; also that 
they prognosticate high winds and great heat^. They are 
also visible in the winter months, and about the south pole, 
but they have no rays proceeding from them. There was a 
dreadful one observed by the Ethiopians and the Egyptians, 
to which Typhon, a king of that period, gave his own name ; 
it had a fiery appearance, and was twisted like a spiral ; its 
aspect was hideous, nor was it like a star, but rather like a 
knot of fire^. Sometimes there are hairs attached to the 
.planets and the other stars. Comets are never seen in the 
western part of the heavens. It is generally regarded as a 
terrific star, and one not easily expiated ; as was the case with 
the civil commotions in the consulship of Octavius, and also 
in the war of Pompey and Caesar^. And in our own age, 
about the time when Claudius Caesar was poisoned and 
left the Empire to Domitius Nero, and afterwards, while the 
latter was Emperor^, there was one which was almost con- 
stantly seen and was very frightful. It is thought important 
to notice towards what part it darts its beams, or from what 
star it receives its influence, what it resembles, and in what 
places it shines. If it resembles a flute, it portends some-

■* Virgil, Geor. i. 488 et seq., Mamhus, i. 904 ef seq., and Lucan, i. 
526 et seq., all speak of the comets and meteors that were observed 
previous to the civil wars between Pompey and Csesar. In reference to 
the existence of a comet about the time of Juhus Caesar, Playfair remarks, 
that Halley supposed the great comet of 1680 to have been the same that 
appeared in the year 44 a.C, and again in Justinian's time, 521 P.c, and 
also in 1106 ; Elem. Nat. Phil. ii. 197, 198. See Ptolemy's Cent. Diet, 
no. 100, for the opinion, that comets presented an omen especially un- 
favourable to kings. To tliis opinion the following passage in the 
Paradise Lost obviously refers ; " And with fear of change pei-plexea 
monarchs." 

5 Seneca refers to the four comets that were seen, after the death of 
Csesar, in the tune of Augustus, of Claudius, and of Nero ; Quscst. Nat. i. 7. 
Suetonius mentions the comet which appeared previous to the death of 
Claudius, cap. 46, and Tacitus that before the death of Nero, Ann. xiv. 22.

thing unfavourable respecting music ; if it appears in the 
parts of the signs referred to the secret members, something 
respecting lewdness of manners ; something respecting wit 
and learning, if they form a triangular or quadrangular 
figure with the position of some of the fixed stars ; and that 
some one will be poisoned, if they appear in the head of either 
the northern or the southern serpent. 

Rome is the only place in the whole world where there is 
a temple dedicated to a comet ; it was thought by the late 
Emperor Augustus to be auspicious to him, from its appear- 
ing during the games which he was celebrating in honour of 
Venus Grenetrix, not long after the death of his father Caesar, 
in the College which was founded by him\ He expressed 
.his joy in these terms : " Diu-ing the very time of these games 
of miQe, a hairy star was seen diu-ing seven days, in the part 
of the heavens which is under the Great Bear. It rose about 
the eleventh hour of the day^, was very bright, and was con- 
spicuous in all parts of the earth. The common people sup- 
posed the star to indicate, that the soul of Csesar was admitted 
among the immortal Gods ; under which designation it was 
that the star was placed on the bust which was lately conse- 
crated in the forum^." This is what he proclaimed in public, 
but, in secret, he rejoiced at this auspicious omen, interpreting 
it as produced for himself; and, to confess the truth, it really 
proved a salutary omen for the world at large'*. 

Some persons suppose that these stars are permanent, and 
that they move through their proper orbits, but that they are 
only visible when they recede from the sun. Others suppose 
that they are produced by an accidental vapour together 
with the force of fire, and that, from this circumstance, they 
are liable to be dissipated^. 

^ " A Julio Csesare. Is enim paulo ante obitton collegium his ludis 
faciendis instituerat, confecto Veneris templo ; " Hardouin in Lemaire, i.

CHAP. 24. (26.) — THE DOCTErPTE OF HIPPAECHTJS^ ABOUT 

THE STAES. 

TMs same Hipparclius, who can never be sufficiently 
commended, as one who more especially proved the relation 
of the stars to man, and that our souls are a portion of 
heaven, discovered a new star that was produced in his own 
age, and, by observing its motions on the day in which it 
shone, he was led to doubt whether it does not often happen, 
that those stars have motion which we suppose to be lixed. 
And the same individual attempted, what might seem pre- 
sumptuous even in a deity, viz. to number the stars for 
posterity and to express their relations by appropriate names ; 
having pre\dously devised instruments", by which he might 
mark the places and the magnitudes of each individual star. 
In this way it might be easily discovered, not only whether 
they were destroyed or produced, but whether they changed 
their relative positions, and likewise, whether they were in- 
creased or diminished; the heavens being thus left as an 
inheritance to any one, who might be found competent to 
complete his plan.

torches, lamps, darts, and beams, which are employed to express dift'erent 
kinds of meteors, have no corresponding words in Eughsh wluch would 
correctly designate them. 

4 From this account it would appear, that the "fax" was what wo 
term a falhng star. " Meteora ista, super cervices nostras transeuntia,

poribus incensis aut electrica vi prognata vidontur, ct quamvis I'requen-

Germanicus Caesar was exhibiting a show of gladiators \ 
There are two kinds of them ; those which are called Imwpades 
and those which are called holides, one of which latter was 
seen during the troubles at Mutina^. They differ from each 
other in this respect, that the faces produce a long train of 
light, the fore-part only being on fire ; while the holides, being 
entirely in a state of combustion, leave a still longer track 
behind them. 

CHAP. 26. TRABES CELESTES ; CHASMA CCELI. 

The trabes also, which are named ^ofcoi', shine in the same 
manner ; one of these was seen at the time when the Lace- 
daemonians, by being conquered at sea, lost their influence 
in Grreece. An opening sometimes takes place in the firma- 
ment, which is named chasma^.

2 This meteor is mentioned by Dion Cassius, lib. xlv. p. 278, but is 
desci'ibed by him as a lampas. 

3 We may presume that the trabes are, for the most part, to be referred 
to the aurora boreahs. The chasma and the appearances described in 
the twenty- seventh chapter are probably varieties of this meteor. On 
these phsenomena we have the following remarks by Seneca : " Lucem in 
aere, seu quamdam albedinem, angustam quidem, sed oblongam, de 
noctu quandoque visam, sereno coelo, si parallelo situ sit, Trabem vocant ; 
si perpendiculari, Columnam ; si, cum cuspide Bolida, sive Jaculum." Nat. 
Qusest. vii. 4, and again, vii. 5, " Trabes autem non transcurrunt nee prse- 
tervolant, ut faces, sed commorantiu*, et in eadem parte coeli collucent." 

^ Seneca describes this meteor, uhi supra, i. 14. " Sunt chasmata, cum 
aliquando coeU spatium discedit, et flammam dehiscens velut in abdito 
ostentat. Colores quoque horum omnium plurimi sunt. Quidam ruboris 
acerritni, quidam evanidse et levis flammge, quidam candidse lucis, quidam 
micantes, quidam sequabihter et sine eruptionibus aut radiis fulvi." Ari-

more dreaded by mortals) wliicli falls down upon tte eartli^, 
such as was seen in tlie third year of the 103rd olympiad, 
when King Philip was disturbing Grreece. But my opinion 
is, that these, like everything else, occur at stated, natural 
periods, and are not produced, as some persons imagine, from a 
variety of causes, such as their fine genius may suggest. They 
have indeed been the precursors of great evils, but I conceive 
that the e^'ils occiu-red, not because the prodigies took place, 
but that these took place because the evils were appointed 
to occur at that period^. Their cause is obscure in con- 
sequence of their rarity, and therefore we are not as well 
acquainted ^\T.th them as we are with the rising of the stars, 
which I have mentioned, and with eclipses and many other 
things. 

CHAP. 28. (28.) — OF CELESTIAL COEON^. 

Stars are occasionally seen along with the sun, for whole 
days together, and generally round its orb, like wTeaths made 
of the ears of corn, or circles of various colours^ ; such as 
occurred when Augustus, while a very young man, was 
entering the city, after the death of his father, in order to 
take upon himself the great name which he assumed"*. (29.) 
The same covoikb occur about the moon and also about the 
principal stars, which are stationary in the heavens. 

1 The meteor here referred to is probably a peculiar form of the 
aurora borealis, which occasionally assumes a red colour. See the re- 
marks of Fouche, in Ajasson, i. 382. 

2 The doctrine of the author appears to be, that the prodigies are not 
the cause, but only the indication of the events wliich succeed them. 
This doctrine is referred to by Seneca ; " Yidebimus an certus omnium 
rerum ordo ducatur, et aha aliis ita complexa sint, ut quod antecedit, 
aut causa sit sequentium aut signura." Nat. Qusest. i. 1. 

3 It would appear that, in this passage, two pha?nomena are confounded 
together ; certain brilhant stars, as, for example, Venus, which have been 
occasionally seen in the day-time, and the formation of different kinds of 
halos, depending on certain states of the atmosphere, which affect its 
transparency. 

^ This occurrence is mentioned by Seneca, Nat. Quoest. i. 2 ; he enters 
into a detailed explanation of the cause ; also by V. Paterculus, ii. 59, 
and by Jul. Obsequens, cap. 128. We can scarcely doubt of tlie reahty 
of the occurrence, as these authors would not have ventured to relate 
what, if not true, might have been bo easily contradicted.

CHAP. 30: — OF TJNUSTTALLT LONG ECLIPSES OF THE SrW. 

Eclipses of the sun also take place which are portentous 
and unusually long, such as occurred when Caesar the Dictator 
was slain, and in the war against Antony, the sun remained 
dim for almost a whole year^. 

CHAP. 31. (31.) — MANY SUNS. 

And again, many suns have been seen at the same time^; not 
above or below the real sun, but in an oblique direction, never 
near nor opposite to the earth, nor in the night, but either 
in the east or in the west. They are said to have been seen 
once at noon in the Bosphorus, and to have continued from 
morning until sunset. Our ancestors have frequently seen 
three suns at the same time'*, as was the case in the consul- 
ship of Sp. Postumius and L. Mucins, of L. Marcius and 
M. Portius, that of M. Antony and Dolabella, and that of 
M. Lepidus and L. Plancus. And we have ourselves seen 
one during the reign of the late Emperor Claudius, when he 

* The term here employed is " arcus," which is a portion only of a circle 
or " orbis." But if we suppose that the sun was near the horizon, a 
portion only of the halo would be visible, or the condition of the atmo- 
sphere adapted for forming the halo might exist in one part onlv, so that 
a portion of the halo only would be obscured. 

2 The dimness or paleness of the sun, which is stated by various writers 
to have occurred at the time of Caesar's death, it is vmnecessary to remark, 
was a phsenomenon totally different from an echpse, and depending on a 
totally different cause. 

3 Aristotle, Meteor. Hb. iii. cap. 2. p. 575, cap. 6. p. 582, 583, and 
Seneca, Qusest. Nat. Hb. i. § 11, describe these appearances under the 
title which has been retained by the moderns of TrapijXia. Aristotle re- 
marks on their cause as depending on the refraction (dvuKXacns) of the 
sun's rays. He extends the remark to the production of halos (a\(us) 
and the rainbow, ubi supra.

These stars occur both at sea and at land. I have seen, 
during the night-watches of the soldiers, a luminous appear- 
ance, like a star, attached to the javelins on the ramparts. 
They also settle on the yard-arms and other parts of ships 
while sailing, producing a Idnd of vocal sound, like that of birds 
flitting about. When they occur singly they are mischievous, 
so as even to sink the vessels, and if they strike on the lower 
part of the keel, setting them on fire"*. When there are two 
of them they are considered auspicious, and are thought to 
predict a prosperous voyage, as it is said that they drive 
away that dreadful and terrific meteor named Helena. On 
this account their eificacy is ascribed to Castor and Pollux, 
and they are invoked as gods. They also occasionally shine 
round the heads of men in the evening^, which is considered 

1 It would be difficTilt to reconcile tliis plisenonienon ■with any acknow- 
ledged atmospherical phsenomenon. 

2 Perhaps the phgenomena here alluded to ought to be referred to some 
electric action ; but they are stated too generally to admit of our forming 
more than a conjecture on the subject. Virgil refers to the occurrence of 
storms of wind after the appearance of a falling star ; Greor. i. 265-6. 

3 These phsenomena are admitted to be electrical ; they are referred to 
by Seneca, Nat. Queest. i. 1. Tliis appearance is noticed as of frequent 
occurrence in the Mediterranean, where it is named the fire of St. Ehno ; 
see Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 311, and Fouche in Ajasson, ii. 382. 

^ Perhaps this opinion may be maintained on the principle, that, when 
there is a single luminous appearance only, it depends upon the discharge 
of a quantity of electrical fluid in a condensed state ; its effects are, in 
this case, those that would follow from a stroke of Hghtning. 

This is said by Livy to have occurred to Servius Tulhus while he was

uncertainty respecting the cause of all these things, and they 
are concealed in the majesty of nature. 

CHAP. 38. (38.)— OP THE AIB ATTD 01^ THE CAUSE OP THE 
SHOWEES OF STONES. 

So far I have spoken of the world itself and of the stars. 
I must now give an account of the other remarkable phseno- 
mena of the heavens. Tor our ancestors have given the 
name of heavens, or, sometimes, another name, air, to_ all the 
seemingly void space, which diftuses around us this vital 
spirit. It is situated beneath the moon, indeed much lower, 
as is admitted by every one who has made observations on 
it and is composed of a great quantity of air from the upper 
regions, mixed with a great quantity of terrestrial vapour, the 
two forming a compound. Hence proceed clouds, thunder 
and lightning of all kinds ; hence also hail, frost, showers, 
storms and whirlwinds ; hence proceed many of the evils 
incident to mortals, and the mutual contests of the various 
parts of nature. The force of the stars keeps down all terres- 
trial things which tend towards the heavens, and the same 
force attracts to itself those things which do not go there 
spontaneously.- The showers fall, mists rise up, rivers are 
dried up, hail-storms rush down, the rays of the sun parch 
the earth, and impel it from all quarters towards the centre. 
The same rays, still unbroken, dart back again, and carry 
with them whatever they can take up. Vapour falls from 
on hic-h and returns again to the same place. Winds arise 
which contain nothing, but which return loaded Tvath spoils. 
The breathing of so many animals draws down the spu^t from 
the hicrher regions ; but this tends to go in a contrary direc 
tion, and the earth pours out its spirit mto the void space 
of the heavens. Thus nature moving to and fro, as if im- 
pelled by some machine \ discord is kindled by the rapid 
motion of the world. Nor is the contest allowed to cease, 
for she is continually whirled round and lays open the causes 
of all things, forming an immense globe about the earth, 
while she again, from time to time., covers this other firma-

ment with clouds^ This is the region of the winds. Here 
their nature principally originates, as well as the causes of 
almost all other things^; since most persons ascribe the 
darting of thunder and lightning to their violence. And to 
the _ same cause are assigned the showers of stones, these 
having been previously taken up by the wind, as well as 
many other bodies in the same way. On this account we 
must enter more at large on this subject. 

CHAP. 39. (39.) — OF THE STATED SEASONS. 

It is obvious that there are causes of the seasons and of 
other things which have been stated, while there are some 
things which are casual, or of which the reason has not yet 
been discovered. Eor who can doubt that summer and 
winter, and the annual revolution of the seasons are caused 
by the motion of the stars ^ ? As therefore the nature of the 
sun is understood to influence the temperature of the year, 
so each of the other stars has its specific power, which pro- 
duces its appropriate effects. Some abound in a fluid re- 
taining its liquid state, others, in the same fluid concreted 
into hoar frost, compressed into snow, or irozen into hail ; 
some are prolific in winds, some in heat, some in vapours, 
some in dew, some in cold. But these bodies must not be 
supposed to be actually of the size which they appear, since 
the consideration of their immense height clearly proves, 
that none of them are less than the moon. Each of them 
exercises its influence over us by its own motions ; this is 
particularly obser^cable with respect to Saturn, wliich pro- 
duces a great quantity of rain in its transits. Nor is this 
power confined to the stars which change their situations, 
but is found to exist in many of the fiLxed stars, whenever 

* "sed assidue rapta (natura) convolvitur, et circa terram immense rerum 
causas globe estendit, subinde per nubes eoelum aliud obtexens." On the 
words " immense globo," idexandre has the following comment : " Im- 
mensis coeli fomicibus appicta sidera,dumcirciimvolvitm% terris ostendit;" 
and on the words "eoelum ahud," "obductse sciHcet nubes falsum quasi 
eoelum vere preetexunt." Lemaire, i. 313. 

2 The author probably means to speak of all the atmospheric phaeno- 
mena that have been mentioned above.

they are impelled by the force of any of the planets, or ex- 
cited by the impulse of their rays ; as we find to be the case 
with respect to the Sucul8e\ which the Greeks, in reference 
to their rainy nature, have termed the Hyades^ There are 
also certain events which occur spontaneously, and at stated 
periods, as the rising of the E:ids^ ^ The star Arcturus 
scarcely ever rises without storms of hail occurring. 

CHAP. 40. (40.)— OF THE EISIIfG OF THE DOG-STAE. 

Wlio is there that does not know that the vapour of the 
sun is kindled by the rising of the Dog-star ? The most 
powerful effects are felt on the earth from this star. When 
it rises, the seas are troubled, the wines in our cellars fer- 
ment, and stagnant waters are set in motion. There is a 
wild beast, named by the Egyptians Oryx, which, when the 
star rises, is said to stand opposite to it, to look steadfastly 
at it, and then to sneeze, as if it were worshiping it^ There 
is no doubt that dogs, during the whole of this period, are 
peculiarly disposed to become rabid\ 

CHAP. 41. (41.) — OF THE EEGTJLAB INFLUENCE OF THE DIF- 
FEEENT SEASONS. 

There is moreover a peculiar influence in the different 
degrees of certain signs, as in the autumnal equinox, and 
also' in the winter solstice, when we find that a particular 
star is connected with the state of the weather^ It is not 
so much the recurrence of showers and storms, as of various 
circumstances, which act both upon animals and vegetables. 
Some are planet-struck^ and others, at stated times, are af- 
fected in the bowels, the sinews, the head, or the intellect.

The olive, the white poplar, and the wiUow turn their leaves 
round at the summer solstice. The herb pulegium, when 
dried and hanging up in a house, blossoms on the very day 
of the winter solstice, and bladders burst in consequence of 
their being distended Avith air\ One might wonder at this, 
did we not observe every day, that the plant named helio- 
trope always looks towards the setting sun, and is, at all 
hours, turned towards him, even when he is obscured by 
clouds". It is certain that the bodies of oysters and of 
whelks^, and of shell-fish generally, are increased in size and 
again diminished by the influence of the moon. Certain 
accurate observers have found out, that the entrails of the 
field-mouse^ correspond in number to the moon's age, and 
that the very small animal, the ant, feels the power of this 
luminary, always resting from her labours at the change of 
the moon. And so much the more disgraceful is our igno- 
rance, as every one acknowledges that the diseases in the 
eyes of certain beasts of burden increase and diminish ac- 
cording to the age of the moon. But the immensity of the 
heavens, divided as they are into seventy-two^ constellations, 
may serve as an excuse. These are the resemblances of cer- 
tain things, animate and inanimate, into which the learned 
have divided the heavens. In these they have announced 
1600 stars, as being remarkable either for their eflfects or 
their appearance ; for example, in the tail of the Bull there 
are seven stars, which are named YergilisB^ ; in his forehead

2 The heliotropium of the modems has not the property here assigned 
to it, and it may be doubted whether it exists in any plant, except in a 
very slight and imperfect degree : the subject will be considered more 
folly in a subsequent part of the work, xxii. 29, where the author gives a 
more particular account of the hehotrope.

it is considerably greater than that stated by Ptolemy and the older astro- 
nomers. See the remarks of Hardotiin and of Brotier ; Lemaire. i. 319.

are the Suculre ; there is also Bootes, which follows the seven 
northern stars ^ 

CHAP. 42. (42.) — OF UNCERTAIN STATES OF THE WEATHEB. 

But I would not deny, that there may exist showers and 
winds, independent of these causes, since it is certain that 
an exhalation proceeds from the earth, which is sometimes 
moist, and at other times, in consequence of the vapours, 
like dense smoke ; and also, that clouds are formed, either 
from the fluid rising up on high, or from the air being com- 
pressed into a fluid'-^. Their density and their substance is 
very clearly proved from their intercepting the sun's rays, 
which are visible by divers, even in the deepest waters^. 

CHAP. 43. (43.) — OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING. 

It cannot therefore be denied, that fire proceeding from 
the stars which are above the clouds, may fall on them, as 
we frequently observe on serene evenings, and that the air is 
agitated by the impulse, as darts when they are hurled whiz 
through the air. And when it arrives at the cloud, a dis- 
cordant kind of vapour is produced, as when hot iron is 
plunged into water, and a wreath of smoke is evolved. Hence 
arise squalls. And if wind or vapour be struggling in the 
cloud, thunder is discharged ; if it bursts out with a flame, 
there is a thunderbolt ; if it be long in forcing out its way, 
it is simply a flash of lightning'*. By the latter the cloud is 
simply rent, by the former it is shattered. Thunder is pro- 

1 " Septemtriones." 

2 The doctrine of Aristotle on the nature and formation of mists and 
clouds is contained in his treatises De Meteor, hb. i. cap. 9. p. 540, and 
De Mundo, cap. 4. p. 605. He employs the terms dryitJs, r-e^os, and 
ve^eXjj, which are translated vapor, nuhes and nebula, respectively. The 
distinction, however, between the two latter does not appear vexy clearly 
marked either in the Greek or the Latin, the two Greek words be^g in- 
discriminately applied to either of the Latin terms. 

3 It is doubthil how far this statement is correct ; see the remarks of 
Hardouin, Lem. i. 320. 

^ The words in the original are respectively fiilmen and fulgetrum ; 
Seneca makes a similar distinction heivfccn fulmen and fiilgu ratio : " Ful- 
guratio est late ignis exphcitus ; fulmen est coactus ignis ot impetu 
jactus." Nat. Quaest. Ub. ii. cap. 16. p. 706.

duced by tlie stroke given to the condensed air, and hence 
it is that the fire darts from the chinks of the clouds. It is 
possible also that the vapour, which has risen from the earth, 
being repelled by the stars, may produce thunder, when it is 
pent up in a cloud ; nature restraining the sound whilst the 
vapour is struggling to escape, but when it does escape, the 
sound bursting forth, as is the case with bladders that are 
distended with air. It is possible also that the spirit, what- 
ever it be, may be kindled by friction, when it is so violently 
projected. It is possible that, by the dashing of the two 
clouds, the lightning may flash out, as is the case when two 
stones are struck against each other. But all these things 
appear to be casual. Hence there are thunderbolts which 
produce no effect, and proceed from no immediate actual 
cause ; by these mountains and seas are struck, and no in- 
jury is done. Those which prognosticate future events pro- 
ceed fi^m on high and from stated causes, and they come 
from their peculiar stars \ 

CHAP. 44. — THE ORIGIN OF WINDS. 

In like manner I would not deny that winds, or rather 
sudden gusts, are produced by the arid and dry vapours of 
the earth ; that air may also be exhaled from water, which 
can neither be condensed into a mist, nor compressed into a 
cloud ; that it may be also driven forward by the impulse of 
the sun, since by the term ' wind' we mean nothing more than 
a current of air, by whatever means it may be produced^. 
!Por we observe winds to proceed from rivers and bays, and 
from the sea, even when it is tranquil ; while others, which 
are named Altani, rise up from the earth ; when they come 
back from the sea they are named Tropcdi, but if they go 
straight on, Apogcei^. 

^ " Prsesertim ex tribus superioribus planetis, uti dictum est, cap. 18." 
nardouin, in Lemaire, i. 322. 

2 Our author's opinion respecting tlie origin of winds nearly agrees 
with that of Aristotle ; " nihil ut ahud ventus (dvefios) sit, nisi aer multus 
fluctuans et compressus, qui etiam spiritus {Trvevfxa) appellatur;" De 
Meteor. This treatise contains a full account of the phsenomena of 
winds. Seneca also remarks, " Yentus est aer fluens ; " Nat. Qusest. lib. 3 
&amp;5.

(44.) The Avindings and the nmnerous peaks of mountains, 
their ridges, bent into angles or broken into defiles, with the 
hollow valleys, by their irregular forms, cleaving the air which 
rebounds from them (which is also the cause why voices are, 
in many cases, repeated several times in succession), give rise 
to winds. * ' 

(45.) There are certain caves, such as that on the coast ot 
Dalmatia, with a vast perpendicular chasm, into which, if a 
light weight only be let down, and although the day be calm, 
a squall issues from it like a whirlwind. The name of the 
place is Senta. And also, in the province of Cyrenaica, there 
is a certain rock, said to be sacred to the south wind, which 
it is profane for a human hand to touch, as the south wind 
immediately rolls forwards clouds of sand\ There are also, 
in many houses, artificial cavities, forme din the walls ^whicli 
produce currents of air; none of these are without their 
appropriate cause,

But there is a great difference between a gale and a wind^ 
The former are uniform and appear to rush forth^ ; they are 
felt, not in certain spots only, but over whole countries, not 
forming breezes or squalls, but \^olent storms\ Wliether 
they be produced by the constant revolution of the world 
and the opposite motion of the stars, or whether they both 
of them depend on the generative spirit of the nature of

origin and meaning of the terms here appUed to the wmds, see the re-

things, "wandering, as it were, up and down in lier womb, or 
whether the air be scourged by the irregular strokes of the 
wandering stars \ or the various j-irojections of their rays, or 
whether they, each of them, proceed from their own stars, 
among which are those that are nearest to us, or whether 
they descend from those that are fixed in the heavens, it is 
manifest that they are all governed by a law of nature, which 
is not altogether unknown, although it be not completely 
ascertained. 

(46.) More than twenty old Grreek writers have published 
their observations upon this subject. And this is the more re- 
markable, seeing that there is so much discord in the world, 
and that it is divided into difterent kingdoms, that is into 
separate members, that there should have been so many who 
have paid attention to these subjects, which are so difficult 
to investigate. Especially when we consider the wars and 
the treachery which everywhere prevail ; while pirates, the 
enemies of the human race, have possession of all the modes 
of communication, so that, at this time, a person may acquire 
more correct information about a country from the writings 
of those who have never been there, than from the inha- 
bitants themselves. "Whereas, at this day, in the blessed 
peace which we enjoy, under a prince who so greatly en- 
courages the advancement of the arts, no new inquiries are 
set on foot, nor do we even make ourselves thoroughly masters 
of the discoveries of the ancients. Not that there were 
greater rewards held out, from the advantages being distri- 
buted to a greater number of persons, but that there were 
more individuals who diligently scrutinized these matters, 
with no other prospect but that of benefiting posterity. It 
is that the manners of men are degenerated, not that the 
advantages are diminished. All the seas, as many as there 
are, being laid open, and a hospitable reception being given 
us at every shore, an immense number of people undertake 
voyages ; but it is for the sake of gain, not of science. Nor 
does their understanding, which is blinded and bent only on 
avarice, perceive that this very thing might be more safely 
done by means of science. Seeing, therefore, that there are 
80 many thousands of persons on the seas, I will treat of the

winds with more minuteness tlian perhaps might otherwise 
appear suitable to my undertaking. 

CHAP. 46. (47.) — THE DIFFEEENT KINDS OF WINDS\ 

The ancients reckoned only four winds (nor indeed does 
Homer mention more") corresponding to the four parts of 
the world ; a very poor reason, as we now consider it. The 
next generation added eight others, but this was too refined 
and minute a di^dsion ; the moderns have taken a middle 
course, and, out of this great number, have added four to the 
original set. There are, therefore, two in each of the four 
quarters of the heavens. From the equinoctial rising of the 
sun^ proceeds Subsolanus'*, and, from his brumal rising, Yul- 
turnus^ ; the former is named by the G-reeks Apeliotes^, the 
latter Eurus. From the south we have Auster, and from the 
brumal setting of the sun, Africus ; these were named Notes 

^ In his account and nomenclatui'e of the winds, Pliny has, for the 
most part, followed Aristotle, Meteor. Hb. ii. cap. 4. pp. 558-560, and 
cap. 6. pp. 563-565. The description of the diiierent winds by Seneca 
is not Yerj different, but where it does not coincide with Aristotle's, our 
author has generally prefen-ed the former ; see Nat. Qusest. Hb. 5. We 
have an account of the different winds, as prevaihng at particular sea- 
sons, m Ptolemy, De Judiciis Astrol. 1. 9. For the nomenclature and 
directions of the wdnds, we may refer to the remarks of Hardouin, Le- 
mahe, i. 328 et seq. 2 Odyss. v. 295, 296. 

3 In giving names to the different wuids, the author designates the 
points of the compass whence they proceed, by the place where the sun 
rises or sets, at the different periods of the year. The followmg are the 
terms which he employs : — " Oriens sequinoctiahs," the place where the 
sun rises at the eqviinox, i. e. the East. " Oriens brumahs," where he 
rises on the shortest day, the S.E. " Occasus brumahs," where he sets 
on the shortest day, the S.W. " Occasus a?quinoctiahs," where he sets 
at the equinox, the W. " Occasus solstitiahs," where he sets on the 
longest day, the N.W. "Exortus solstitiahs," where he rises on the 
longest day, the N.E. " Inter septemtrionem et occasum solstitialem," 
between N. and N.W., N.N.W. " Inter aqiulonem et exortum aequi- 
noctialem," between N. and N.E., N.N.E. " Inter ortura brumalem et 
meridiem," between S. and S.E., S.S.E. " Inter meridiem et hybcrnum 
occidentem," between S. and.S.W., S.S.W.

and from tlie solstitial setting, Corns" ; these were named 
Zephyrus and Argestes. From the seven stars comes Sep- 
temtrio, between which and the solstitial rising we have 
Aquilo, named Aparctias and Boreas^. By a more minnte 
subdivision we interpose four others, Thrascias, between 
Septemtrio and the solstitial setting ; Csecias, between Aquilo 
and the equinoctial rising ; and Phoenices, bet^veen the brumal 
rising and the south. And also, at an equal distance from 
the south and the winter setting, between Libs and Notes, 
and compounded of the two, is Libonotos. Nor is this all. 
Per some persons have added a wind, which they have named 
Meses, between Boreas and Caecias, and one between Eurus 
and Notes, named Euronotus"*. 

There are also certain winds peculiar to certain coimtries, 
which do not extend beyond certain districts, as Sciron in 
Attica, deviating a little from Ai'gestes, and not known in 
the other parts of Grreece. In other places it is a little 
higher on the card and is named Olympias ; but all these

have gone by tlie name of Argestes. In some places Csecias 
is named Hellespontia, and the same is done in other cases. 
In the province of Narhonne the most noted wind is Circius ; 
it is not inferior to any ot the winds in violence, frequently- 
driving the waves before it, to Ostia\ straight across the Li- 
gurian sea. Yet this same wind is unknown in other parts, 
not even reaching Yienne, a city in the same province ; for 
meeting with a high ridge of hills, just before it arrives at 
that district, it is checked, although it be the most violent of 
all the winds. Tab ins also asserts, that the south winds 
never penetrate into Egj-pt. Hence this law of nature is 
obvious, that winds have their stated seasons and limits. 

CHAP. 47. — THE PEEIODS OF THE WINDS^. 

The spring opens the seas for the navigators. In the be- 
ginning of this season the west winds soften, as it were, the 
winter sky, the sun having now gained the 25th degree of 
Aquarius ; this is on the sixth day before the Ides of February^. 
This agrees, for the most part, witli all the remarks that I 
shall subsequently make, oiily anticipating the period by one 
day in the intercalary year, and again, prcser\ang the same 
order in the succeeding lustrum'*. After the eighth day be- 
fore the Calends of March", Favonius is called by some Che- 
lidonias^, from the swallows making their appearance. The 
wind, which blows for the space of nine days, from the seventy- 
first day after the Avinter solstice'^, is sometimes called Orni- 
thias, from the arrival of the birds^. In the contrary direc- 
tion to Favonius is the wind which we name Subsolanus, and 

1 This wind must have been N.N.W. ; it is mentioned by Strabo, iv.

tins is connected with the rising of the Yergiliae, in the 25th 
degree of Taurus, six days before the Ides of May\ which is 
the time when south winds prevail: these are opposite to 
Septemtrio. The dog-star rises in the hottest time of the 
summer, when the sun is entering the first degree of Leo^ ; 
this is fifteen days before the Calends of August. The north 
winds, which are called Prodromi^, precede its rising by about 
eight days. But in two days after its rising, the same north 
winds, which are named Etesise"*, blow more constantly during 
this period ; the vapour from the sun, being increased twofold 
by the heat of this star, is supposed to render these winds 
more mild ; nor are there any which are more regular. After 
these the south winds become more frequent, until the appear- 
ance of Arcturus^, which rises eleven days before the autumnal 
equinox. At this time Corns sets in ; Corns is an autumnal 
■wind, and is in the opposite direction to Yulturnus. After 
this, and generally for forty-four days after the equinox, at 
the setting ot the Yergilise, the winter commences, which 
usually happens on the third of the Ides of November^. This 
is the period of the winter north wind, which is very unlike 
the summer north wind, and which is in the opposite direc- 
tion to Africus. For seven days before the winter solstice, 
and for the same length of time after it, the sea becomes 
calm, in order that the king-fishers may rear their young ; 
from this circumstance they have obtained the name of the 
halcyon days^ ; the rest of the season is winterly^. Tet the

Those are the coldest winds which are said to blow from 
the seven stars, and Corns, which is contiguous to them ; 
these also restrain the others and dispel the clouds. The 
moist ^vinds are Africus, and, still more, the Auster of Italy. 
It is said that, in Pontus, Csecias attracts the clouds. The 
dry winds are Corns and Vulturnus, especially when they 
are about to cease blowing. The ^\dnds that bring snow are 
Aquilo and Septemtrio ; Septemtrio brings hail, and so does 
Corns ; Auster is sultry, Vulturnus and Zephyrus are warm. 
These winds are more dry than Subsolanus, and generally 
those which blow from the north and west are more dry than 
those which blow from the south and east. Aquilo is the 
most healthy of them all ; Auster is unhealthy, and more so 
when dry ; it is colder, perhaps because it is moist. Animals 
are supposed to have less appetite for food when this wind is 
blowing. The Etesiae generally cease during the night, and 
spring up at the third hour of the day^. In Spain and in 
Asia these winds have an easterly direction, in Pontus a 
northerly, and in other places a southerly dii'ection. They 
blow also after the winter solstice, when they are called Or- 
nithise^, but they are more gentle and continue only for a 
few days. There are two winds which change their nature 
with their situation; in Africa Auster is attended with a 
clear sky, while Aquilo collects the clouds\ Almost all 

less irregular than those of England, Pliny has considerably exaggerated 
the real fact. 

^ On this subject the reader may peruse the remarks of Seneca, Nat. 
Qusest. V. 18, written in his style of flowery declamation. 

2 The greatest part of the remarks on the nature of the winds, in tliis 
chapter, woidd appear to be taken from Aristotle's Treatise De Meteor., 
and it may be stated generaUy, that our author has formed liis opinions 
more upon those of the Greek writers than upon actual observation. 

3. 9 A.M. ^ In the last chapter Omitliias is said to be a west wind. 

* This obviously depends upon the geographical situation of the north- 
em parts of Africa, to which the observation more particularly apphes, 
with respect to the central part of tlie Continent and the Mediterranean.

winds blow in their turn, so that when one ceases its oppo- 
site springs up. AVTien winds which are contiguous succeed 
each other, they go from left to right, in the direction of the 
sun. The fourth day of the moon generally determines their 
direction for the whole of the monthly period^ We are able 
to sail in opposite directions by means of the same wind, if 
we have the sails properly set ; hence it frequently happens 
that, in the night, vessels going in different directions rim 
against each other. Auster produces higher winds than 
Aquilo, because the former blows, as it were, from the bot- 
tom of the sea, while the latter blows on the surface ; it is 
therefore after south winds that the most mischievous earth- 
quakes have occurred. Auster is more violent during the 
night, Aquilo during the day ; winds from the east continue 
longer than from the west. The north winds generally cease 
blowing on the odd days, and we observe the prevalence of 
the odd numbers in many other parts of nature ; the male 
winds are therefore regulated by the odd numbers^. The 
sun sometimes increases and sometimes restrains winds ; 
when rising and setting it increases them ; while, when on 
the meridian, it restrains them during the summer. They 
are, therefore, generally lulled during the middle of the day 
and of the night, because they are abated either by excessive 
cold or heat ; winds are also lulled by showers. "We gene- 
rally expect them to come from that quarter where the clouds 
open and allow the clear sky to be seen. Eudoxus^ sup- 
poses that the same succession of changes occurs in them 
after a period of four years, if we observe their minute re- 
volutions ; and this applies not only to winds, but to what- 
ever concerns the state of the weather. He begins his lus- 
trum at the rising of the dog-star, in the intercalary year. 
So far concerning winds in general. 

1 The influence of the fourth day of the moon is referred to by Yirgil, 
Geor. i. 432 et seq. " Sin ortu quarto," &amp;c. 

2 This refers to the genders of the names of the winds, analogous to 
the remark in note ^j p. 71. 

^ Eudoxus was a native of Cnidus, distinguished for his knowledge in 
astrology and science generally ; he was a pupil of Plato, and is referred 
to by many of the ancients ; see Hardouin's Index Auctorum, in Lemaire, 
i. 187, and Enfield's Hist, of Phil. i. 412, with the very copious list of 
references.

CHAP. 49. (48.) — EC^"EPHIAS AND TTPHOK. 

And now respecting the sudden gusts \ wHcli arising from 
tlie exhalations of the earth, as has been said above, and 
falling down again, being in the mean time covered by a 
thin him of clouds, exist in a variety of forms. By their 
wandering about, and rushing down like torrents, in the 
opinion of some persons, they produce thunder and light- 
ning'. But if they be urged on with greater force and 
violence, so as to cause the rupture of a dry cloud, they pro- 
duce a squall^, which is named by the Greeks Ecnephias^. 
But, if these are compressed, and rolled up more closely to- 
gether, and then break without any discharge of fire, i. e. 
without thunder, they produce a squall, which is named Ty- 
phon^, or an Ecnephias in a state of agitation. It carries 
along a portion of the cloud which it has broken oif, rolling 
it and turning it round, aggravating its own destruction by 
the weight of it, and whirling it from place to place. This 
is very much di'eaded by sailors, as it not only breaks their 
sail-yards, but the vessels themselves, bending them about 
in various ways. This may be iu. a slight degree counter- 
acted by sprinkling it with vinegar, when it comes near us, 
this substance being of a very cold nature ^ This wind, 
when it rebounds after the stroke, absorbs and carries up 
whatever it may have seized on.

Stoics ; De Div. ii. 44. ^ 3 " procella." _

as a combination of a whirlwind and a hurricane. 

* Plutarch, Sympos. Quaest. iii. 5, refers to the extraordiaary power of 
vinegar in extinguishing fire, but he ascribes this effect, not to its cold- 
ness, but to the extreme tenuity of its parts. On this Alexandre remarks, 
" Mehus factum negassent Plinius ct Plutarchus, quam causam inanem 
rei absurdissimaj excogitarent," Lcmau-e, i. 344.

But if it burst from the cavity of a cloud which is more 
depressed, but less capacious than what produces a squaU, 
and is accompanied by noise, it is called a whirlwind, and 
throws down everything which is near it. The same, when 
it is more burning and rages with greater heat, is called a 
blasting wind^, scorching and, at the same time, throwing 
down everything with which it comes in contact. (49.) Ty- 
phon never comes from the north, nor have we Ecnephias 
when it snows, or when there is snow on the ground. K it 
breaks the clouds, and, at the same time, catches fire or 
burns, but not until it has left the cloud, it forms a thunder- 
bolt. It differs from Prester as flame does from fire ; the 
former is difiiised in a gust, the latter is condensed with a 
violent impulse^. The whirlwind, when it rebounds, diflers 
from the tornado in the same manner as a loud noise does 
from a dash. 

The squall differs from both of them in its extent, the 
clouds being more properly rent asimder than broken into 
pieces. A black cloud is formed, resembling a great animal, 
an appearance much dreaded by sailors. It is also called a 
pillar, when the moisture is so condensed and rigid as to be 
able to support itself. It is a cloud of the same kind, which, 
when drawn into a tube, sucks up the water^.

comparing the account given by Aristotle and by Seneca ; the former in

different causes ; the air, wbicL is condensed in the winter, 
is made still more dense by a thicker covering of clouds, 
while the exhalations from the earth, being all of them rigid 
and ft'ozen, extinguish whatever fiery vapour it may receive. 
It is this cause which exempts Scythia and the cold districts 
round it from thunder. On the other hand, the excessive 
heat exempts Eg^-pt ; the warm and diy vajDours of the earth 
being very seldom condensed, and that only into light clouds. 
But, in the spring and autumn, thimder is more frequent, 
the causes which produce summer and ^dnter being, in each 
season, less efhcient. From this cause thimder is more fre- 
quent in Italy, the air being more easily set in motion, in 
consequence of a milder winter and a showery summer, so 
that it may be said to be always spring or autumn. Also m 
those parts of Italy which recede from the north and lie to- 
wards the south, as in the district round oiu* city, and in 
Campania, it lightens equally both in winter and in summer, 
which is not the case in other situations.

AYehaveaccountsof many different kinds of thunder-storms. 
Those which are dry do not biu-n objects, but dissipate them ; 
while those Avhich are moist do not biu'n, but blacken them. 
There is a third kind, which is called bright lightning', of a 
very wonderful nature, by which casks are emptied, Avithout 
the vessels themselves being injured, or there being any other 
trace left of their operation^. Gold, copper, and silver are 
melted, while the bags which contain them are not in the 
least burned, nor even the wax seal much defaced. Marcia, 
a lady of high rank at Bome, was struck while pregnant ; 
the fa?tus was destroyed, while she herself survived \n ithout

be principally taken from Aristotle ; Meteor, iii. 1. Some of the phse- 
nomena mentioned below, wliich would natm-tdly appear to the ancients 
the most remarkable, are easily explained by a referenco to their electrical 
origin. ^ " quod clarum voeant."

place at the time of Catiline's conspiracy, M. Herennius, a

ning when the sky was without clouds^. 

CHAP. 53. (52.) THE ETETJEIAlSr' AKD THE EOMAK 

OBSEEYATION'S ON THESE POINTS. 

The Tuscan books inform us, that there are nine Grods 
who discharge thunder-storms, that there are eleven differ- 
ent kinds of them, and that three of them are darted out by 
Jupiter. Of these the Romans retained only two, ascribing 
the diurnal kind to Jupiter, and the nocturnal to Summa- 
nus"* ; this latter kind being more rare, in consequence of 
the heavens being colder, as was mentioned above. The 
Etrurians also suppose, that those which are named Infernal 
burst out of the ground ; they are produced in the winter 
and are particularly fierce and direful, as all things are which 
proceed from the earth, and are not generated by or proceed- 
ing from the stars, but from a cause which is near at hand, 
and of a more disorderly nature. As a proof of this it is 
said, that all those Avhich proceed from the higher regions 
strike obliquely, while those which are termed terrestrial 
strike in a direct line. And because these fall from matter 
which is nearer to us, they are supposed to proceed from the 
earth, since they leave no traces of a rebound ; this being 
the effect of a stroke coming not from below, but from an 
opposite quarter. Those who have searched into the subject 

^ This effect may be easily explained by the agitation into wliich the 
female might have been thrown. The title of " princeps Eomanarum," 
which is apphed to Marcia, has given rise to some discussion among the 
commentators, for which see the remarks of Hardouin and Alexandre, in 
Lemaire, i. 348. 

2 Sometimes a partial thunder-cloud is formed, while the atmosphere 
generally is perfectly clear, or, as Hardouin suggests, the effect might 
have been produced by a volcanic eruption. See Lemaire, i. 348. 

3 Seneca gives us an accoxmt of the opinions of the Tuscans ; Nat. 
Qusest. ii. 32 ; and Cicero refers to the " hbri fulgurales" of the Etrurians ; 
De Divm. i. 72. 

* According to Hardouin, "Summanus est Deus summus Manium, 
idem Orcus et Pluto dictus," Lemaire, i. 349 ; he is again referred to

remark, " quisquis is est."

more minutely suppose, that these come froin the plauet 
Saturn, as those tliat are of a barning nature do from Mars. 
In this way it was that Yolsiniiun, the most opulent town of 
the Tuscans, was entirely consumed by lightning\ The 
first of these strokes that a man receives, after he has come 
hito possession of any property, is termed Familiar-, and is 
supposed to prognosticate the events of the whole of his life. 
But it is not generally supposed that they predict events of 
a private nature for a longer space than ten years, unless 
they happen at tlie time of a first marriage or a birth-day ; 
nor that public predictions extend beyond thirty years ^, un- 
less with respect to the founding of colonies ^. 

CHAP. 5i. (53.) — or CONJTJEIIS'G UP THUJTDER. 

It is related in our Annals, that by certain sacred rites 
and imprecations, thunder-storms may be compelled or in- 
voked^ There is an old report in Etruria, that thunder was 
invoked when the city of Volsinium had its territory laid 
waste by a monster named Yolta^. Thunder was also in- 

^ The city of Bolsena is supposed to occupy the site of the ancient 
Yolsuiiura. From the nature of the chstrict in which it is situate, it is 
perhaps more probable, that tlie event alluded to in the text was produced 
by a volcanic eruption, attended by hghtning, than by a simple thvmder- 
storm. 

2 " Yocant et familiaria quae prima fiimt famiham suam cuique 

indepto." This remark is explained bv the followhig passage from Seneca ; 
ISTat. Quaest. ii. 47. " Hsec sunt fuhnina, qua; pruno accepto patrimonio, 
in novo hominis aut m'bis statu fiunt." Tliis opinion, as well as most of 
those of om* author, respecting the auguries to be formed from thmider, 
is combated by Seneca ; iihi supra, § 48. 

2 Tliis opinion is also referred to by Seneca in the following passage ; 
"privata autem fidmina ncgant ultra decunum annum, pubhca ultra 
trigesimum posse defem ;" ubi supra.

voked by King Porsenna. And L. Piso\ a ycyj respectable 
author, states in the first book of his Annals, that this had 
been frequently done before his time by Numa, and that 
Tullus Hostilius, imitating him, but not having properly 
performed the ceremonies, was struck A'^dth the lightning^. 
We have also groves, and altars, and sacred places, and, among 
the titles of Jupiter, as Stator, Tonans, and Teretrius, we 
have a Jupiter Elicius^. The opinions entertained on this 
point are very various, and depend much on the dispositions 
of different individuals. To believe that we can command 
nature is the mark of a bold mind, nor is it less the mark of 
a feeble one to reject her kindness^. Our knowledge has 
been so far useful to us in the interpretation of thimder, 
that it enables us to predict what is to happen on a certain 
day, and ,we learn either that our fortune is to be entirely 
changed, or it discloses events which are concealed from us ; 
as is proved by an infinite number of examples, public and 
private. Wherefore let these things remain, according to 
the order of nature, to some persons certain, to others doubt- 
ful, by some approved, by others condemned. I must not, 
however, omit the other circumstances connected with them 
which deserve to be related. 

CHAP. 55. (54.) — GEIfERAL LAWS OF LIGHTNIlirGI-. 

It is certain that the lightning is seen before the thunder 
is heard, although they both take place at the same time. 
Nor is this wonderful, since light has a greater velocity than 
sound. Nature so regulates it, that the stroke and the sound 
coincide^ ; the sound is, however, produced by the discharge 
of the thunder, not by its stroke. But the air is impelled

Nunc quoque te celebrant, Ehciumqvie vocant." 

"* " beneficiis abrogare vires."

quicker than the lightning^ on which account it is that every- 
thing is shaken and blcwTi up before it is struck, and that a 
person is never injui'ed Avheu he has seen the lightning and 
heard the thunder; Thunder on the left hand is supposed 
to be luckv, because the east is on the left side of the hea- 
vens". We do not regard so much the mode in which it comes 
to us, as that in which it leaves us, whether the fire rebounds 
after the stroke, or whether the current of air returns when 
the operation is concluded and the fire is consumed. In rela- 
tion to this object the Etrurians have divided the heavens into 
sixteen parts^. The first great division is fi'om north to east ; 
the second to the south ; the third to the west, and the fourth 
occupies what remains from west to north. Each of these has 
been subdivided into four parts, of which the eight on the east 
have been called the left, and those on the west the right divi- 
sions. Those which extend from tlie west to the north have 
been considered the most unpropitious. It becomes therefore 
very important to ascertain from what quarter the thunder 
proceeds, and in what dii'ection it falls. It is considered a 
very favourable omen when it returns into the eastern divi- 
sions. But it prognosticates the greatest felicity when the 
thunder proceeds from the first-mentioned part of the heavens 
and falls back into it ; it was an omen of tliis kind which, as we 
have heard, w as given to Sylla, the Dictator. The remaining 
quarters of the heavens are less propitious, and also less to 
be dreaded. There are some kinds of thunder which it is 
not thought right to speak of, or even to listen to, unless 
when they have been disclosed to the master of a family or 
to a parent. But the futility of this observation was de- 
tected when the temple of Juno was struck at Eome, during

It lightens without thunder more frequently in the night 
than in the day^. Man is the only animal that is not always 
killed by it, all other animals being killed instantly, nature 
having granted to him this mark of distinction, while so many 
other animals excel him in strength. All animals fall down 
on the opposite side to that which has been struck ; man, 
unless he be thrown down on the parts that are struck, does 
not expire. Those who are struck directly from above sink 
down immediately. When a man is struck while he is awake, 
he is found with his eyes closed ; when asleep, with them 
open. It is not considered proper that a man killed in this 
way should be burnt on the funeral pile ; our religion enjoins 
us to bury the body in the earth ^. No animal is consumed 
by lightning unless after having been previously killed. 
The parts of the animal that have been wounded by light- 
ning are colder than the rest of the body. 

CHAP. 56. (55.) OBJECTS. WHICH AEE NEVER STRTJCK. 

Among the productions of the earth, thunder never strikes 
the laurel^, nor does it descend more than five feet into the 
earth. Those, therefore, who are timid consider the deepest 
caves as the most safe ; or tents made of the skins of the 
animal called the sea-calf, since this is the only marine ani- 
mal which is never struck^ ; as is the case, among birds, with 
the eagle ; on this account it is represented as the bearer of

est, ut nullo igne decinerescat." 

^ Although it has been thought necessary by M. Fee, in the notes to 
Ajasson's trans., ii. 384, 385, to enter into a formal examination of this 
opinion of the author's, I conceive that few of our readers will agree with 
hun in tliis respect.

CHAP. 57. (56.) — SHOWEES or MILK, BLOOD, FLESH, lEON, 
WOOL, AND BAKED TILES^. 

Besides these, we learn from certain monuments, that from 
the lower part of the atmosphere^ it rained milk and blood, 
in the consulship of M'Acilius and C. Porcius, and frequently 
at other times'*. This was the case with respect to flesh, in 
the consulship of P. Yolumnius and Servius Sulpicius, and it 
is said, that what was not devoured by the birds did not be- 
come putrid. It also rained iron among the Lucanians, the 
year before Crassus was slain by the Parthians, as well as all 
the Lucanian soldiers, of whom there was a great number in 
this army. The substance which fell had very much the ap- 
pearance of sponge^ ; the augurs warned the people against

claws. 

2 There is strong evidence for the fact, that, at different times, various 
substances have fallen from the atmosphere, sometimes apparently of mi- 
neral, and, at other times, of anunal or vegetable origin. Some of these 
are now referred to those pecuhar bodies termed aerohtes, the nature and 
source of which are still doubtful, although their existence is no longer 
so. These bodies have, in other instances, been evidently discharged from 
distant volcanoes, but there are many cases where the substance could not 
be supposed to have proceeded from a volcano, and where, in the present 
state of our knowledge, it appears impossible to offer an explanation of 
their natm-e, or the source whence they are derived. We may, however, 
conclude, that notwithstanding the actual occurrence of a few cases of 
tliis description, a great proportion of those enumerated by the ancients 
were either entirely T\ithout fomidation or much exaggerated. We meet 
with several variations of what we may presmne to have been aerohtes in 
Livy ; for example, xxiv. 10, xxx. 38, xli. 9, xliii. 13, and xhv. 18, among

cordingly happened, in the daytime, in a part of Thrace, at 
the river ^gos. The stone is now to be seen, a waggon- 
load in size and of a burnt appearance ; there was also a 
comet shining in the night at that time'. But to believe 
that tliis had been predicted would be to admit that the di- 
vining powers of Anaxagoras were still more wonderful, and 
that our knowledge of the nature of things, and indeed every 
thing else, would be thrown into confusion, were we to sup- 
pose either that the sun is itself composed of stone, or that 
there was even a stone in it ; yet there can be no doubt that 
stones have frequently fallen from the atmosphere. There 
is a stone, a small one indeed, at this time, in the Grymna- 
sium of Abydos, which on this account is held in veneration, 
and which the same Anaxagoras predicted would fall in the 
middle of the earth. There is another at Cassandria, formerly 
called Potidsea^, which from this circumstance was built in 
that place. I have myself seen one in the country of the 
Yocontii'*, which had been brought from the fields only a 
short time before. 

CHAP. 60. (59.) THE RAINBOW. 

"What we name Eainbows frequently occur, and are not 
considered either wonderful or ominous ; for they do not 
predict, with certainty, either rain or fair weather. It is 
obvious, that the rays of the sun, being projected upon a 
hollow cloud, the light is thrown back to the sun and is re- 

^ There is some variation in the exact date assigned by diflferent authors 
to this event ; in the Chronological table in Brewster's Encyc. vi. 420, it 
is said to have occurred 467 B.C. 

2 Aristotle gives us a similar accoimt of this stone ; that it feU in the 
daytime, and that a comet was then visible at night ; Meteor, i. 7. It is 
scarcely necessary to remark, that the authority for this fact must be re- 
ferred entirely to Ai'istotle, without receiving any adchtional weight from 
our author. The occurrence of the comet at the same time with the 
aerohte must have been entirely incidental.

never produced except in the part oppositeto the sun, nor even 
in any other form except that of a semicircle. Nor are they 
ever formed at night, although Aristotle asserts that they are 
semetimes seen at that time ; he acknowledges, however, that 
it can only be on the 14th day of the moon^. They are seen 
in the winter the most frequently, when the days are short- 
ening, after the autumnal equinox^. They are not seen when 
the days increase again, after the vernal equinox, nor on the 
longest days, about the summer solstice, but frequently at 
the winter solstice, when the days are the shortest. "When 
the sun is low they are high, and when the sun is high they 
are low ; they are smaller when in the east or west, but are 
spread out wider ; in the south they are small, but of a 
greater span. In the summer they are not seen at noon, 
but after the autumnal equinox at any hour : there are never 
more than two seen at once.

Meteor, iii. 2, 3, 4, and 5, where he gives an account of the pha?nomena, 
which is, for the most part, correct, and attempts to form a theory for 
them ; see especially cap. 4. p. 577 et seq. In the treatise De Mundo he 
also refers to the same subject, and briefly sums up his doctrine with the 
foUowing remark : " arcus est species segmenti Solaris vel lunaris, edita in 
nube humida, et cava, et perpetua ; quam velut in speculo intuemur, ima- 
gine relata in speciem circularis ambitus." cap. 4. p. 607. Seneca also

Nat. Qusest. i. 3-8.

frequently seen in the summer, because the sun is more elevated, and that, 
consequently, a less portion of the arch is visible. See also Seneca, Nat.

bail itself falls more frequently during the day than tbe night, 
and is more quickly melted than snow. There are no mists 
either in the summer or diu-ing the greatest co] d of wmter. 
There is neither dew nor hoar formed during great beat or

There are, moreover, certain peculiarities in certain places. 
In Africa dew falls during the night in summer. In Italy, 
at Locri, and at the Lake Velinum, there is never a day 
in which a rainbow is not seen^ At Ehodes and at Syracuse 
the sky is never so covered with clouds, but that the sun is 
visible at one time or another ; these things, however, will

produce spontaneously ! "What odours and flowers, nutritive 
juices, forms and colours ! With what good faith does she

his own destruction, or that we may not seek our death in 
the ocean, and become food for our graves, or that our bodies 
may not be gashed by steel. On this account it is that na- 
ture has produced a substance which is very easily taken, and 
by which life is extinguished, the body remaining undefiled 
aiid retaining all its blood, and only causing a degree of 
thirst. And when it is destroyed by this means, neither 
bird nor beast will touch the body, but he who has perished 
by his own hands is reserved for the earth. 

* But it must be acknowledged, that ever^i;hing which the 
earth has produced, as a remedy for our evils, we have con- 
verted into the poison of oiu- lives. Eor do we not use iron, 
which we caimot do without, for this purpose ? But although 
this cause of mischief has been produced, we ought not to 
complain ; we ought not to be ungrateful to this one part of 
nature \ How many luxuries and how many insults does 
she not bear for us ! She is cast into the sea, and, in order 
that we may introduce seas into her bosom, she is washed 
away by the waves. She is continuallytortiu^edfor her iron,lier 
timber, stone, foe, corn, and is even much more subservient 
to our luxm'ies than to om' mere support. What indeed she 
endures on her siu-face might be tolerated, but we penetrate 
also into her bowels, digging out the veins of gold and silver, 
and the ores of copper and lead ; we also search for gems and 
certain small pebbles, driving oiu* trenches to a great depth. 
We tear out her entrails in order to extract the gems ^vith 
which we may load our fingers. How many hands are worn 
do\\Ti tliat one little joint may be ornamented ! If the in- 
fernal regions really existed, certainly these burrows of ava- 
rice and luxury would have penetrated into them. And truly 
we wonder that this same earth should have produced any- 
thing noxious ! But, I suppose, the savage beasts protect 
her and keep otF our sacrilegious liands"-. I'or do we not dig 
among serpents and handle poisonous plants along with those 
veins of gold ? But the Goddess shows herself more pro- 
pitious to us, inasmuch as all this wealth ends in crimes,

Every one agrees that it has the most perfect figure^^. 
"We- always speak of the ball of the earth, and we admit it 
to be a globe bounded by the poles. It has not indeed the 
form of an absolute sphere, from the number of lofty moun- 
tains and flat plains ; but if the termination of the lines be 
bounded by a curved this would compose a perfect sphere. 
And this we learn fr'om arguments drawn from the nature of 
things, although not from the same considerations which we 
made use of with respect to the heavens. Por in these the 
hollow convexity everywhere bends on itself, and leans upon 
the earth as its centre. "Whereas the earth rises up solid 
and dense, like something that swells up and is protruded 
outwards. The heavens bend towards the centre, while the 
earth goes from the centre, the continual rolling of the 
heavens about it forcing its immense globe into the form of 
a sphere^.

where the author remarked upon the form of the earth as perfect in all 
its parts, and especially adapted for its supposed position in the centre of

erer, remark, that Hardouin interprets it in a somewhat different manner ;

vertices montium circulus exigatur." Lemaire, i. 370.

and the vulgar. We inaintain, that there are men dispersed 
over everv part of the earth, that they stand with their feet 
turned towards each other, that the vault of the heavens ap» 
pears alike to all of them, and that they, all of them, appear to 
tread equally on the middle of the earth. If any one should 
ask, why those situated opposite to us do not fall, we directly 
ask in return, whether those on the opposite side do not 
wonder tha*. we do not fall. But I may make a remark, that 
will appear plausible even to the most unlearned, that if the 
earth were of the figure of an unequal globe, like the seed of a 
pine\ still it may be inhabited in every part. 

But of how little moment is this, when we have another 
miracle rising up to our notice ! The earth itself is pendent 
and does not fall Avith us ; it is doubtful whether this be from 
the force of the spirit which is contained in the universe % or 
whether it would fall, did not nature resist, by allo^ving of 
no place where it might fall. Tor as the seat of fire is no- 
where but in fire, nor of water except in water, nor of air 
except in air, so there is no situation for the earth except in 
itself, everything else repelling it. It is indeed wonderful 
that it should form a globe, when there is so much flat sur- 
face of the sea and of the plains. And this was the opinion 
of Dic£earchus, a peculiarly learned man, who measured the 
heights of mountains, under the direction of the kings, and 
estimated Pelion, which was the highest, at 1250 paces per- 
pendicular, and considered this as not affecting the round 
figure of the globe. But this appears to me to be doubtful, 
as I well know that the summits of some of the Alps rise 
up by a long space of not less than 50,000 paces^ But what 

» As our author admits of the existence of antipodes, and expressly 
states that the earth is a perfect sphere, we may conclude that the re- 
semblance to the cone of the pine is to be taken in a very general sense. 
IIow far the ancients entertained correct opinions respecting the globular 
figure of the earth, or rather, at what period tliis opinion became geneniUy 
admitted, it is perhaps not easy to ascertain. The lines in the Georgics, 
i, 242, 213, which may be supjiosed to express the popular opinion in the 
time of Virgil, certainly do not convey the idea of a sphere capable of 
being inhabited m all its parts : 

Hie vertex nobis semper subUmis ; at illuni 
Sub pedibus Styx atra vidct, Dinnesquc profundi. 

' " spiritus vis mimdo nclusi."

the Tulgar most strenuously contend against is, to be com- 
pelled to believe that tiie water is forced into a rounded 
figure^ ; yet there is nothing more obvious to the sight among 
the phaenomena of natm^e. For we see every wiiere, that 
drops, when they hang down, assume the form of small globes, 
and when they are covered with dust, or have +he down of 
leaves spread over them, tliey are observed to be completely 
round ; and when a cup is filled, the liquid swells up in the 
middle. But on account of the subtile nature of the fluid 
and its inherent softness, the fact is more easily ascertained 
by oiu- reason than by our sight. And it is even more 
w onderful, that if a very little fluid only be added to a cup 
when it is full, the superfluous quantity runs over, whereas 
the contrary happens if we add a solid body, even as much 
as would weigh 20 denarii. The reason of this is, that what 
is dropt in raises up the fluid at the top, while what is poured 
on it slides ofi" From the projecting surface. It is from 
the same cause^ that the land is not visible from the body 
of a ship when it may be seen from the mast ; and that 
when a vessel is receding, if any bright object be fixed to the 
mast, it seems gradually to descend and finally to become 
invisible. And the ocean, which we admit to be without 
limits, if it had any other figiu'e, could it cohere and exist 
without falling, there being no external margin to contain 
it ? And the same wonder still recurs, how is it that the 
extreme parts of the sea, although it be in the form of a 
globe, do not fall down ? In opposition to which doctrine, 
the G-reeks, to their great joy and glory, were the first to 
teach us, by their subtile geometry, that this could not hap- 
pen, even if the seas were flat, and of the figure which they 
appear to be. For since water always runs from a higher to 

millibus passuum assurgere." To avoid the apparent improbability of the 
author conceiving of the Alps as 50 miles high, the commentators have, 
accorduig to their usual custom, exercised their ingentiity in altering the 
text. See Poinsinet, i. 206, 207, and Lemaire, i. 373. But the expres- 
sion does not imply that he conceived them as 50 miles in perpendicular 
height, but that there is a continuous ascent of 50 miles to get to the 
eummit. This explanation of the passage is adopted by Alexandre; Lemaire, 
ut supra. For what is known of Dicsearchus I may refer to Hardouin, 
Index Auctonma, in Lemah^e, i. 181.

a lower level, and this is admitted to be essential to it, no 
one ever doubted that the water would accumulate on any 
shore, as much as its slope would allow it. It is also certain, 
that the lower an}i;hing is, so much the nearer is it to the 
centre, and that all the lines which are dra-v\Ti from this point 
to the water which is tlie nearest to it, are shorter than those 
which reach from the beginnmg of the sea to its extreme 
parts ^ Hence it follows, that all the water, from every part, 
tends towards the centre, and, because it has this tendency, 
does not fall. 

CHAP. 66. HOW THE WATEE IS CONJfECTED WITH THE EAETH. 

OF THE NAYIGATION OF THE SEA AND THE EIVEES. 

"We must believe, that the great artist, Nature, has so 
arranged it, that as the arid and dry earth cannot subsist by 
itself and without moisture, nor, on the other hand, can the 
water subsist unless it be supported by the earth, they are 
connected by a mutual union. The earth opens her harbours, 
while the water pervades the whole earth, within, without, 
and above ; its veins running in all directions, like connect- 
ing links, and bursting out on even the highest ridges ; 
where, forced up by the air, and pressed out by the weight 
of the earth, it shoots forth as from a pipe, and is so far from 
being in danger of falling, that it bounds up to the highest 
and most lofty places. Hence the reason is obvious, why 
the seas are not increased by the daily accession of so many 
rivers^. 

(66.) The earth has, therefore, the whole of its globe girt, 
on every side, by the sea flowing round it. And this is not &amp;, 

^ " Quam quse ad extremum marc a priinis aqviis." T profess myself 
altogether unable to follow the author's mode of reasoning in this para-

in favour of the actual flatness of the surface of the ocean, whereas his 
previous remarks prove its convexity.

CHAP. 67. (67.) — WHETHEE THE OCEAN SUEEOIINDS THE 

EAETH. 

The whole of the western ocean is now navigated, from Gades 
and the Pillars of Hercules, round Spain and Gaul. The 
greater part of the northern ocean has also been navigated, 
imder the auspices of the Emperor Augustus, his fleet having 
been carried roimd Germany to the promontory of the Cimbri^; 
from which spot they descried an immense sea, or became ac- 
quainted with it by report, which extends to the country of 
the Scythians, and the districts that are chilled by excessive 
moisture^. On this account it is not at all probable, that 
the ocean should be deficient in a region where moisture so 
much abounds. In like manner, towards the east, from the 
Indian sea, all that part which lies in the same latitude^, and 
which bends round towards the Caspian*, has been explored 
by the Macedonian arms, in the reigns of Seleucus and An- 
tiochus, who wished it to be named after themselves, the Se- 
leucian or Antiochian Sea. About the Caspian, too, many parts 
of the shores of the ocean have been explored, so that nearly 
the whole of the north has been sailed over in one direction 
or another. Nor can our argument be much affected by the 
point that has been so much discussed, respecting the Palus 
Mreotis, whether it be a bay of the same ocean^, as is, I under- 
stand, the opinion of some persons, or whether it be the 
overflowing of a narrow channel connected with a different 
ocean^ On the other side of Gades, proceeding from 
the same western point, a great part of the southern ocean,

2 What is here spoken of we may presume to have been that part of

along Mauritania, has now been navigated. Indeed the 
greater part of this region, as well as of the east, as far as the 
Arabian Grulf, was siu-veyed in consequence of Alexander's 
victories. When Caius Caesar, the son of Augustus \ had the 
conduct of affairs in that coimtry, it is said tliat they found the 
remains of Spanisli vessels which had been wrecked there. 
While the power of Carthage was at its height, Hanno pub- 
lished an account of a voyage which he made from Gades to 
the extremity of Arabia-; Himilcowas also sent, about the 
same time, to explore the remote parts of Europe. Besides, 
we learn from Corn. jSTepos, that oneEudoxus, a contemporary 
of his^ when he was flying from king Lathyrus, set out from 
the Arabian Gulf, and was carried as far as Gades-*. And long 
before him, Caelius Autipater^ informs us, that he had seen 
a person who had sailed from Spain to Ethiopia for the pur- 
poses of trade. The same Cornelius Xepos, when speaking of 
the northern circumnavigation, tells us that Q.MetellusCeler, 
the colleague of L. Afranius in the consulship, but then a 
proconsul in GauP, had a present made to him by the king 
of the Suevi, of certain Indians, who sailing from India for 
the piu-pose of commerce, had been driven by tempests into 
Germany ^ Thus it appears, that the seas which flow corn- 
different parts of his work, ii. 112 and vi. 7, appear so inconsistent with 
each other, that we must suppose he indiscriminately borrowed tliem from 
various writers, without comparing their accoimts, or endeavouring to 
reconcile them to each otlier. Such inaccm-acies may be thouglit ahnost 
to justify the censure of Alexandre, who styles our author, " indiligens 
plane veri et falsi compilator, et ubi dissentiunt auctores, nunquam aut 
raro sibi constans." Lemaire, i. 378.

to the Clu-istian a?ra. Ptolemy Lathyrus commenced liis reign u.c. 627

pletely round tlie globe, and divide it, as it were, into two 
parts \ exclude us from one part of it, as there is no way open 
to it on either side. And as the contemplation of these 
things is adapted to detect the vanity of mortals, it seems 
incumbent on me tc display, and lay open to our eyes, the 
whole of it, whatever it be, in which there is nothing which 
can satisfy the desires of certain individuals. 

CHAP. 68. (68.) WHAT PAET OP THE EAETH IS INHABITED. 

In the first place, then, it appears, that this should be esti- 
mated at half the globe^, as if no portion of this half was 
encroached upon by the ocean. But surrounding as it does 
the whole of the land, pouring out and receiving all the other 
waters, furnishing whatever goes to the clouds, and feeding the 
stars themselves, so numerous and of such great size as they 
are, what a great space must we not suppose it to occupy ! 
This vast mass must fill up and occupy an infinite extent. 
To this we must add that portion of the remainder which the 
heavens^ take from us. For the globe is divided into five 
parts^, termed zones, and all that portion is subject to severe 
cold and perpetual frost which is under the two extremities, 
about each of the poles, the nearer of which is called the 
north, and the opposite the south, pole. In all these regions 
there is perpetual darkness, and, in consequence of the aspect 
of the milder stars being turned from them, the light is ma- 
lignant, and only like the whiteness which is produced by 
hoar frost. The middle of the earth, over which is the orbit 
of the sun, is parched and burned by the flame, and is con- 
sumed by being so near the heat. There are only two of the 
zones which are temperate, those which lie between the torrid 
and the frigid zones, and these are separated from each other, 
in consequence of the scorching heat of the heavenly bodies.

Chap. 68.] EXTENT OF THE OCEAI?'. 10 1 

It appears, tlierefore, that the heavens take from us three 
parts of the earth ; how much the ocean steals is uncertain. 
And with respect to the part which is left us, I do not 
know whether that is not even in greater danger. This same 
ocean, insinuating itself, as I have described it, into a num- 
ber of bays, approaches with its roaring^ so near to the in- 
land seas, that the Ai'abian Gulf is no more than 115 miles 
from the Egyptian Sea"-, and the Caspian only 375 miles from 
the Euxine. It also insinuates itself into the numerous seas 
by which it separates Africa, Europe, and Asia ; hence how 
much space must it occupy ? We must also take into ac- 
count the extent of all the rivers and the marshes, and we 
must add the lakes and the pools. There are also the moun- 
tains, raised up to the heavens, wdth their precipitous fronts ; 
we must also subtract the forests and the craggy valleys, the 
wildernesses, and the places, which, from various causes, are 
desert. The vast quantity which remains of the earth^, or 
rather, as many persons have considered it, this speck of a 
world"* (for the earth is no more in regard to the universe), 
tbis is the object, the seat of our glory — here we bear our 
honours, here we exercise our power, here we covet wealth, 
here we mortals create our disturbances, here we continually 
carry on our wars, aye, civil wars, even, and unpeople the 
earth by mutual slaughter. And not to dwell on public feuds, 
entered into by nations against each other, here it is that we 
drive away our neighbours, and enclose the land thus seized 
upon within our own fence ^ ; and yet the man who has most 
extended his boundary, and has expelled tlie inhabitants for 
ever so great a distance, after all, what mighty portion of the 
earth is he master of? And even when his avarice has been 
the most completely satisfied, what part of it can he take 
with him into the grave ? 

^ "".... iiitema maria allatrat, . . ." 

2 This is considerably more than the distance in the present day. 
The Istlimus of Suez appears, according to the statement of the most 
accurate geographers, to be about 70 miles in breadth.

CHAP. 69. (69.) THAT THE EABTH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF 

THE WORLD. 

It is evident from undoubted arguments, that the earth is 
in the middle of the universe \ but it is the most clearly 
proved by the equality of the days and the nights at the equi- 
nox^. It is demonstrated by the quadrant^, which affords 
the most decisive confirmation of the fact, that unless the 
earth was in the middle, the days and nights could not be 
equal ; for, at the time of the equinox, the rising and setting 
of the sun are seen on the same line, and the rising of the 
sun, at the summer solstice, is on the same line with its. 
setting at the winter solstice ; but this could not happen if 
the earth was not situated in the centre 

CHAP. 70. (70.) or THE OBLIQUITY OE THE ZONES^ 

The three circles^, which are connected with the above- 
mentioned zones, distinguish the inequalities of the seasons ; 
these are, the solstitial circle, which proceeds from the part 
of the Zodiac the highest to us and approaching the nearest 
to the district of the north ; on the other side, the brumal, 
which is towards the south pole ; and the equinoctial, which 
traverses the middle of the Zodiac. 

CHAP. 71. or THE INEQUALITY OF CLIMATES. 

The cause of the other things which are worthy of our 
admiration depends on the figure of the earth itself, which, 
together with all its waters, is proved, by the same argu- 
ments, to be a globe. This certainly is the cause why the 
stars of the northern portion of the heavens never set to us, 
and why, on the other hand, those in the south never rise, 
and again, why the latter can never be seen by the former, 
the globe of the earth rising up and concealing them. The

Northern TVaiu is never seen in Troglodytice^ nor in EgA^)t, 
whicli borders on it^ ; nor can we, in Italy, see the star Ca- 
nopns^, or Berenice's Hair^ ; nor what, under the Emperor 
Augustus, was named Caesar's Throne, although they are, 
there^, very brilliant stars. Tlie curved form of the earth is 
so obvious, rising up like a ridge, that Canopus appears to a 
spectator at Alexandi'ia to rise above the horizon almost the 
quarter of a sign ; the same star at Hhodes appears, as it 
were, to graze along the earth, while in Pontus it is not seen 
at all ; where the Northern Wain appears considerably 
elevated. This same constellation cannot be seen at Rhodes, 
and still less at Alexandi^ia. In Ai-abia, in the month of 
November, it is concealed during the tirst watch of the 
night, but may be seen during the second^; in Meroe it is 
seen, for a short time, in the evening, at the solstice, and it 
is visible at day-break, for a few days before the rising of 
Arcturus^. These facts have been principally ascertained 
by the expeditions of na\igators ; the sea appearing more 
elevated or depressed in certain parts ^ ; the stars suddenly 
coming into view, and, as it were, emerging from the water, 
after having been concealed by the bulging out of the globe ^.

Argo ; we have a similar statement in Manihus, i. 216, 217. 

^ The commentators suppose that the star or constellation here referred 
to cannot be the same with what bears this name on the modem celestial 
atlas ; vide Hardouin in loco, also Marc, in Ajasson, ut supra. The

of Alexandre, who explains the terms "adverso" and "prono," "ascen- 
denti ad polum," and "ad austrum devoxo ;" a similar sense is given to 
the passage by Poinsinet and Ajasson, in their translations.

pole, otherwise^ its stars would be seen from all parts of the 
world ; they indeed are supposed to be higher by those who 
are nearest to them, but the stars are sunk below the horizon 
to those who are more remote. As this pole appears to be 
elevated to those who are beneath it ; so, when we have 
passed along the convexity of the earth, those stars rise up, 
which appear elevated to the inhabitants of those other di- 
stricts ; all this, however, could not happen unless the earth 
had the shape of a globe. 

CnAP. 72. — Ilf WHAT PLACES ECLIPSES ABE INVISIBLE, AND 
WHY THIS IS THE CASE. 

Hence it is that the inhabitants of the east do not see 
those eclipses of the sun or of the moon which occur in the 
evening, nor the inhabitants of the west those in the morn- 
ing, while such as take place at noon are more frequently 
visible^. We are told, that at the time of the famous vic- 
tory of Alexander the Grreat, at Arbela'"', the moon was 
eclipsed at the second hour of the night, while, in Sicily, the 
moon was rising at the same hour. The eclipse of the sun 
which occurred the day before the calends of May, in the 
consulship of Vipstanus and I^onteius"*, not many years ago, 
was seen in Campania between the seventh and eighth hour 
of the day ; the general Corbulo informs us, that it was seen 

1 " Aut ;" as Poinsinet remarks, " aut est ici pour alioqui ;" and he 
quotes another passage from our author, xix. 3, where the word is employed 
in a similar manner. 

2 We may presume that the author meant to convey the idea, that 
the echpses which are visible in any one country are not so in those 
which are situated under a diiFerent meridian. The terms "vesperti- 
nos," "matutinos," and " meridianos," refer not to the time of the day, 
but to the situation of the echpse, whether recurring in the western, 
eastern, or southern parts of the heavens. 

3 Brewster, in the art. " Chronology," p. 415, mentions this echpse as 
having taken place Sept. 21st, tt.C. 331, eleven days before the battle of 
Arbela ; wliile, in the same art. p. 423, the battle is said to have taken 
place on Oct. 2nd, eleven days after a total echpse of the moon. 

■* It took place on the 30th of April, in the year of tlie City 811, 
A.D. 59 ; see Brewster, uhi supra. It is simply mentioned by Tacitus, 
Ann. xiv. 12, as having occurred among other prodigies which took place 
at this period.

in Armenia, between the eleventh and twelfth hour^ ; thus the 
curve of the globe both reveals and conceals different objects 
from the inhabitants of its different parts. If the earth had 
been flat, everything would have been seen at the same time, 
from every part of it, and the nights would not have been 
unequal; while the equal intervals of twelve hours, which are 
now observed only in the middle of the earth, would in that 
case have been the same everywhere. 

CHAP. 73. (71.) WHAT EEGULATES THE DAYLIGHT OS THE 

EARTH. 

Hence it is that there is not any one night and day the same, 
in all parts of the earth, at the same time ; the intervention of 
the globe producing night, and its turning round producing 
day'. This is known by various observations. In Africa and 
in Spain it is made evident by the Towers of HannibaP, and in 
Asia by the beacons, which, in consequence of their dread of 
pirates, the people erected for their protection ; for it has been 
frequently observed, that the signals, which were lighted a,t 
the sixth hour of the day, were seen at the third hour of the 
night by those who were the most remote"*. Philonides, a 

1 "We have an account of Corbiilo's expedition to Armenia in Dion Cas- 
sius, ]x. 19-24, but there is no mention of the echpse or of any peculiar 
celestial phsenomenon. 

2 The teiTHs employed in the original are " oppositu" and " ambitu." 
Alexandre's explanation of the first is, "quum globi teiTaquei crassitude 
interposita sohs arcet radios ;" and of the second, " quvun nostra hujus 
globi pars a sole ambitm\" Lemaire, i. 389. 

3 One of these towers is mentioned by Livy, xxxiii. 48 ; it is said to 
have been situated between AchoUa and Thapsus, on the sea-coast. 

* Hardouin, according to his usual custom, employs aU liis learning 
and ingenuity to give a plausible explanation of tliis passage. Alexandre, 
as it must be confessed, with but too much reason, remarks, " Frustra 
desudavit Harduinus ut sanum aliquem scnsmn ex iUis Plinii delira- 
mentis excuteret." He correctly refers the interval of time, which was 
said to occur between these signals, not to any astronomical cause, but to 
the necessary delay which took place in the transmission of them. He 
concludes, " Sed ad cursum sohs hoc referre, dementia; est. Nam ut tanta 
horarum differentia iutersit, si moram onmem in speculandis ao trans- 
mittendLs signis sustuleris, necessc erit observatores illos ultimos 135

courier of the above-mentioned Alexander, went from Sicjon 
to Elis, a distance of 1200 stadia, in nine hours, while he 
seldom returned until the third hour of the night, although 
the road was do^\Ti-hilP. The reason is, that, in going, he 
followed the course of the sun, while on his return, in the 
opposite direction, he met the sun and left it behind him. 
For the same reason it is, that those who sail to the west, 
even on the shortest day, compensate for the difficulty of 
sailing in the night and go farther", because they sail in the 
same direction with the sun. 



CHAP. 74. (72.) — REMARKS OK DIALS, AS CONNECTED WITH 

THIS SUBJECT. 

The same dial-plates^ cannot be used in all places, the 
shadow of the sun being sensibly different at distances of 
300, or at most of 500 stadia"*. Hence the shadow of the dial- 
pin, which is termed the gnomon, at noon and at the summer 
solstice, in Egypt, is a little more than half the length of the 
gnomon itself. At the city of Home it is only -g less than 
the gnomon, at Ancona not more than -^j less, while in 
the part of Italy which is called Venetia, at the same hour, 
the shadow is equal to the length of the gnomon^. 

^ The distance, as here stated, is about 150 miles, which he is said to 
have performed m nine hours, but that the same distance, in retm-ning, 
required fifteen hours. We have here, as on the former occasion, a note 
of Hardouin's to elucidate the statement of the author. On this Alex- 
andre observes, " Optime ; sed in tam parva locorum distantia, Ehdis et 
Sicyonis horologia vix qumque unius horse sexagesimis diiFerre poterant ; 
quare eunti ac redeunti ne discrimen quidem quadrantis liora; intererat. 
Ineptos igitur auctores sequitur hoc quoque loco Plinius." Lemaire, i. 
390, 391. 

2 " Vincunt spatia noctumae navigationis." Tliis expression would ap- 
pear to imply, that the author conceived some physical difficulty m sail- 
ing during the night, and so it seems to be understood by Alexandre ; 
vide not. in loco. 

^ " Vasa horoscopica." " Yasa horoscopica appeUat horologia in piano

accordingly find, that our author, when referring to the subject in hia 



Chap. 75.] SHADOWS. 107 

CHA.P. 75. (73.) — WHEK AND WHEEE THERE ARE NO 
SHADOWS. 

It is likewise said, that in tlie town of Syeue, which is 
5000 stadia south of Alexandria^ there is no shadow at noon, 
on the day of the solstice ; and that a well, which was sunk 
for the purpose of the experiment, is illuminated by the sun 
in every part. Hence it appears that the sun, in this place, 
is vertical, and Onesicritus informs us that this is the case, 
about the same time, in India, at the river Hypasis'. It is 
well known, that at Berenice, a city of the Troglodytae, and 
4820 stadia beyond that city, in the same country, at the 
town of Ptolemais, which was built on the Eed Sea, when 
the elephant was first hunted, this same thing takes place 
for fortj^-five days before the solstice and for an equal length 
of time after it, and that during these ninety days the shadows 
are turned towards the south^. Again, at Meroe, an island 
in the Nile and the metropolis of the ^Ethiopians, which is 
5000 stadia** from Syene, there are no shadows at two periods 
of the year, ^dz. when the sun is in the 18th degree of Taurus 
and in the lltli of Leo^ The Oretes, a people of India, have 
a mountain named Maleus^ near which the shadows in sum- 



6th book, ch. 39, makes the shadow at Ancona -^-^ greater than the gnomon, 
while, in Venctia, which is moi*e northerly, he says, as in the present 
chapter, that the shadow and the gnomon are equal in length. See the 
remarks of M. Alexandre in Lemau'c, uf supra. 

* This would be about 625 miles. Strabo, ii. 114, and Lucan, ii. 587, 
give the same distance, which is probably neai'ly correct. 8yene is, 
however, a Httle to the north of the tropic. 

2 This remark is not correct, as no part of tins river is between the 
tropics. For an account of Onesicritus see Lemaire, i. 203, 204. 

^ " In meridiem mnbras jaci." M. Ajasson translates this passage, " les 
ombres tombent pendant quatre-vingl-dix jours sur Ic point central du

rect, "for 90 days' space aU the shadows are cast into the south." i. 36. 

The remarks of M. Alexandre are to tlie same efiect ; " ut bis solem 

in zenitho haberet (Ptolemais), Maii mensis et Augusti initio ; interea

The seven stars of the Great Bear are visible there for fifteen 
nights only. In India also, in the celebrated sea-port Pa-

towards the south. "While Alexander was staying there it 
was_ observed, that the seven northern stars were seen only 
during the early part of the nightl Onesicritus, one of his 
generals, inforins us in his work, that in those places in India 
where there are no shadows, the seven stars are not visible^ ; 
these places, he says, are called " AsciaV and the people there

island of Patale as situated near the mouth of the Indus ; he again refers 
to it, xii. 25. His account of the position of the sun does not, however, 
apply to tliis place. 

2 If we may suppose this to have been actually the case, we might 
calculate the time of the year when Alexander visited this place and the 
length of liis stay.

in those places, they are occasionally invisible ; hteraUy the observation

consists of twelve aequinoctial hours and eight parts of an 
hour\ at Alexandria of fourteen hours, in Italy of fifteen, in 
Britain of seventeen ; where the degree of light, ^Yhieh exists 
in the night, very clearly proves, what the reason of the thing 
also obliges us to believe, that, during the solstitial period, 
as the sun approaches to the pole of the world, and his orbit 
is contracted, the parts of the earth that lie below him have 
a day of six months long, and a night of equal length when 
he is removed to the south pole. Pytheas, of Marseilles^, 
informs us, that this is the case in the island of Thule^, which 
is six days' sail from the north of Britain. Some persons

poraries.

Isles. What is here asserted respecting the length of the day, as well as 
its distance from Britain, would indeed apply much more correctly to 
Iceland than to Shetland ; but we have no evidence that Iceland was 
known to the ancients. Our author refers to the length of the day in 
Thule in two subsequent parts of his work, iv. 30 and vi. 36.

CHAP. 79 (77.) — OP THE MODE 1^ WHICH THE DATS ARE 

COMPUTED. 

The days have been computed by different people in dif- 
ferent ways. The Babylonians reckoned from one sunrise 
to the next ; the Athenians from one sunset to the next ; the 
TJmbrians from noon to noon ; the multitude, universally, 
from light to darkness ; the Eoman priests and those who 
presided over the civil day, also the Egyptians and Hippar- 
chus, from midnight to midnight^ It appears that the in- 
ter^^al from one sunrise to the next is less near the solstices 
than near the equinoxes, because the position of the zodiac 
is more oblique about its middle part, and more straight 
near the solstice^. 

CHAP. 80. (78.) — OP THE DIPPEREIS'CE OP NATIONS AS DE- 
PENDING ON THE NATURE OP THE WORLD. 

To these circumstances we must add those that are con- 
nected with certain celestial causes. There can be no doubt, 
that the Ethiopians are scorched by their vicinity to the 
sun's heat, and they are bom, like persons who have been 
burned, with the beard and hair frizzled^ ; while, in the 
opposite and frozen parts of the earth, there are nations with 
white skins and long light hair. The latter are savage 
from the inclemency of the climate, while the former are 
dull from its variableness"*. We learn, from the form of the 

^ A. Grellius, iii. 3, informs us, that the question concerning the com- 
mencement of the day was one of the topics discussed by Yarro, La his 
book "Rerum Humanarum : " this work is lost. We learn fi'om the 
notes of Hardouin, Lemaire, i. 399, that there are certain counti'ies in 
which aU these various modes of computation are still practised ; the 
last-mentioned is the one commonly employed in Europe. 

2 It has been supposed, that in. this passage the author intended to 
say no more than that the nights are shorter at the summer solstice than 
at the other parts of the year ; see Alexandre in Lemau-e, i. 399, 400. 
But to this, I conceive, it may be objected, that the words " inter ortus 
Bolis " can scarcely apply to the period while the sun is below the horizon, 
and that the solstices generally would seem to be opposed to the equinoxes 
generally. Also the words "obhquior " and " rectior " would appear to 
have some farther reference than merely to the length of time during 
which the sun is above or below the horizon.

the upper parts of the body, while in the other, being a

In the cold regions savage beasts are produced, and in the 
others, various forms of animals, and many kinds of birds^. 
In both situations the body grows tall, in the one case by 
the force of fire, and in the other by the nutritive moisture. 

In the middle of the earth there is a salutary mixture of 
the two, a tract fruitful in all things, the habits of the body 
holding a mean between the two, with a proper tempering 
of colours ; the manners of the people are gentle, the intellect 
clear^, the genius fertile and capable of comprehending every 
part of nature. They have formed empires, which has never 
been done by the remote nations ; yet these latter have never 
been subjected by the former, being severed from them and 
remaining solitary, hom the effect produced on them by 
their savage nature. 

CHAP. 81. (79.) OF EARTHQUAKES. 

According to the doctrine of the Babylonians, earthquakes 
and clefts of the earth, and occurrences of this kind, are 
supposed to be produced by the influence of tlie stars, 
especially of the three to which they ascribe thunder'* ; and 
to be caused by the stars moving with the sun, or being in 
conjunction with it, and, more particularly, when they are 
in the quartile aspect^. If we are to credit the report, a

appear to sanction the opinion of onr author ; " Siccos esse, quibus maera 
eiint crura ; humidos, quibus crassa." 

2 The latter part of the remark is correct, but the number of ferocious 
animals is also greater in the warmer regions ; there is, in fact, a greater 
variety in all the productions of nature in the warmer districts of the 
globe, except in those particular spots where animal or vegetable life is 
counteracted by some local circumstances, as in many parts of Asia and 
Africa by the want of water.

most admirable and immortal spirit, as it were of a divine 
nature, should be ascribed to Anaximander the Milesian, 
who, they say, warned the Lacedaemonians to beware of their 
city and their houses\ For he predicted that an earthquake 
was at hand, when both the whole of their city was destroyed 
and a large portion of Mount Taygetus, which projected in 
the form of a ship, was broken off, and added farther ruin to 
the previous destruction. Another prediction is ascribed to 
Pherecydes, the master of Pythagoras, and this was divine ; 
by a draught of water from a well, he foresaw and predicted 
that there would be an earthquake in that place ^. And if 
these things be true, how nearly do these individuals ap- 
proach to the Deity, even during their lifetime ! But I 
leave every one to judge of these matters as he pleases. I 
certainly conceive the winds to be the cause of earthquakes ; 
for the earth never trembles except when the sea is quite 
calm, and when the heavens are so tranquil that the birds 
cannot maintain their flight, all the air which should support 
them being withdrawn^ ; nor does it ever happen until after 
great winds, the gust l3eing pent up, as it were, in the 
fissures and concealed hollows, Por the trembling of the 
earth resembles thunder in the clouds ; nor does the yaAvning 
of the earth differ from the bursting of the lightning ; the 
enclosed air struggling and striving to escape"*.

3 It has been observed that earthquakes, as well as other great con- 
vulsions of nature, are preceded by calms ; it has also been observed 
that birds and animals generally exliibit certain presentiments of the 
event, by something peculiar in their motions or proceeduigs ; this cir- 
cumstance is mentioned by Aristotle, Meteor, ii. 8, and by Seneca, Nat.

do^vll, and in others swallowed up by a deep cleft' ; some- 
times great masses of earth are heaped up, and rivers forced 
out, sometimes even flame and hot springs'-, and at others 
the course of rivers is turned. A terrible noise precedes 
and accompanies the shock^ ; sometimes a murmuring, like 
the lowing of cattle, or like human voices, or the clashing of 
arms. This depends on the substance which receives the 
sound, and the shape of the caverns or crevices through 
which it issues ; it being more shrill from a narrow opening, 
more hoarse from one that is curved, producing a loud rever- 
beration from hard bodies, a sound like a boiling fluid^ from 
moist substances, fluctuating in stagnant water, and roaring 
when forced against solid bodies. There is, therefore, often 
the sound without any motion. Nor is it a simple motion, 
but one that is tremulous and vibratory. The cleft some- 
times remains, displaying what it has swallowed up ; some- 
times concealing it, the mouth being closed and the soil 
being brought over it, so that no vestige is left ; the city 
being, as it were, devoured, andthetract of country engulfed. 
Maritime districts are more especially subject to shocks. 
Nor are mountainous tracts exempt from them ; I have found, 
by my inquiries, that the Alps and the Apennines are fre- 
quently shaken. The shocks happen more frequently in the 
autumn and in the spring, as is the case also wdth thunder. 
There are seldom shocks in Gaul and in Egypt ; in the latter 
it depends on the prevalence of summer, in the former, of 
winter. They also happen more frequently in the night than 
in the day. The greatest shocks are in the morning and tlie 
evening ; but they often take place at day-break, and some- 
times at noon. They also take place during eclipses of the 
sun and of the moon, because at that time storms are lulled. 
They are most frequent when great heat succeeds to showers, 
or showers succeed to great heat^.

CHAP. 83. (81.) — SIGNS of an APPROACHiisra eaiithqhake. 

There is no doubt tliat earthquakes are felt by persons on 
shipboard, as they are struck by a sudden motion of the 
waves, without these being raised by any gust of wind. 
And things that are in the ressels shake as they do in houses, 
and give notice by their creaking ; also the birds, when they 
settle upon the vessels, are not without tlieir alarms. There 
is also a sign in the heavens ; for, when a shock is near at 
hand, either in the daytime or a little after sunset, a cloud 
is stretched out in the clear sky, like a long thin line^ The 
water in wells is also more turbid than usual, and it emits a 
disagreeable odour^.

also the case where there is a number of caverns, for they 
give vent to the confined vapour, a circumstance which has 
been remarked in certain towns, which have been less shaken 
where they have been excavated by many sewers. And, in 
the same town, those parts that are excavated'* are safer than 
the other parts, as is understood to be the case at Naples in 
Italy, the part of it which is solid being more liable to injury. 
Arched buildings are also the most safe, also the angles of 
walls, tlie shocks counteracting each other ; walls made of 
brick also suffer less from the shocks*. There is also a great

difference in the nature of the motions \ Tvhere various mo- 
tions are experienced. It is the safest when it vibrates and 
causes a creaking in tlie building, and where it swells and 
rises upwards, and settles with an alternate motion. It is 
also harmless Avhen the buildings coming together butt 
against each other in opposite directions, for the motions 
counteract each other. A movement like the rolling of waves 
is dangerous, or when the motion is impelled in one direction. 
The tremors cease when the vapour bursts out'-^ ; but if 
they do not soon cease, they continue for forty days ; gene- 
rally, indeed, for a longer time : some have lasted even for 
one or two years.

OCCURRED ONCE ONLY. 

A great prodigy of the earth, whicli never happened more 
than once, I have found mentioned in thebooks of the Etruscan 
ceremonies, as having taken place in the district of Mutina, 
during the consulship of Lucius Martins and Sextus Julius^. 
Two mountains rushed together, falhng upon each other 
Avith a very loud crash, and then receding ; while in the day- 
time flame and smoke issued from them ; a great crowd of 
Eomau knights, and families of people, and travellers on the 
^milian way, being spectators of it. All the farm-houses 
were throwTi down by the shock, and a great number of 
animals that were in them were killed ; it was in the year 
before the Social war ; and I am in doubt whether this event 
or the civil commotions Avere more fatal to the territory of 
Italy. The prodigy which happened in our own age was no 
less wonderful ; in the last year of the emperor IS^ero"*, as I 
have related in my history of his times^, when certain lielda 
and olive grounds in the district of ]Marrucinum, belonging 
to Vectius Marcellus, a Eoman knight, the steward of Nero,

CHAP. 86. (84.) — WONDEEPUL CIECUMSTANCES ATTENDING 
EAETHQUAKES. 

Inundations of the sea take place at the same time with 
earthquakes^ ; tlie water being impregnated with the same 
spirit^, and received into the bosom of the earth which 
subsides. The greatest earthquake which has occurred in 
our memory was in the reign of Tiberius"*, by which twelve 
cities of Asia were laid prostrate in one night. They occurred ' 
the most frequently during the Punic war, when we had 
accounts brought to Eome of fifty-seven earthquakes in the 
space of a single year. It was during this year^ that the 
Cartliaginians and the Eomans, who were fighting at the 
lake Thrasimenus, were neither of them- sensible of a very 
great shock during the battle^. Nor is it an evil merely 
consisting in the danger which is produced by the motion ; 
it is an equal or a greater evil when it is considered as a 
prodigy*^. The city of E-ome never experienced a shock, 
which was not the forerunner of some great calamity.

siirface\ For the land is not merely produced by what is 
brought do\\m the rivers, as the islands called Echinades are 
formed by the river Achelous, and the greater part of Egypt 
by the Nile, where, according to Homer, it was a day and a 
night's journey from the main land to the island of Pharos^ ; 
but, in some eases, by the receding of the sea, as, according 
to the same author, was the case with the Circsean isles'^ 
The same thing also happened in the harbour of Ambracia, 
for a space of 10,000 paces, and was also said to have taken 
place for 5000 at the Piraeus of Athens'*, and likewise at 
Ephesus, Avhere formerly the sea washed the walls of the 
temple of Diana. Indeed, if we may believe Herodotus^, the 
sea came beyond Memphis, as far as the mountains of JEthi- 
opia, and also from the jijlains of Arabia. The sea also siu'- 
rounded Ilium and the whole of Teuthrania, and covered the 
plain through which the Mseander flows ^ 

CHAP. 88. (86.) THE MODE I&gt;r WHICH ISLANDS EISE UP. 

Land is sometimes formed in a different manner, risinsr 
suddenly out of the sea, as if nature was compensating the 
earth for its losses', restoring in one place what she had 
swallowed up in another. 

1 This phgenomenon is distinctly referred to by Seneca, Nat. Queest. 
vi. 21. It presents us AAatli one of those cases, where the scientific de- 
ductions of the modems have been anticipated by the speculations of the 
ancients. 

- Odyss. iv. 354—357 ; see also Arist. Meteor, i. 14 ; Lucan, x. 509-511 ; 
Seneca, Nat. Qunest. vi. 26 ; Herodotus, ii. 4, 5 ; and Strabo, i. 59. 

3 These form, at tliis day, the Monte Circello, wliich, it is remarked, 
rises up hke an island, out of the Pontine marshes. It seems, however, 
difficult to conceive how any action of the .sea could have formed these 
marshes. 

•• See Strabo, i. 58. ^ ii. 5. et alibi. 

^ The plain in which this river flows, forming the \\-indinf^s from which 
it derives its name, appears to have been originally an hilet of the sea, 
which was gradually filled up with alluvial matter.

Delos and Ehodes\ islands wliicli have now been long

lately there have been some smaller islands formed ; Anapha, 
which is beyond Melos ; ]S"ea, between Lemnos and the

Therasia, among the Cyclades, in the fourth year of tlie

afterwards, Hiera, also called Automate^ made its appear- 
ance ; also Thia, at the distance of two stadia from the 
former, 110 years afterwards, in our own times, when M. 
Junius Silanus and L. Balbus were consuls, on the 8th of 
the ides of July^. 

(88.) Opposite to us, and near to Italy, among the ^Eolian 
isles, an jsland emerged from the sea ; and likewise one near 
Crete, 2500 paces in extent, and with warm springs in it ; 
another made its appearance in the third year of the 163rd 
Olympiad"^, in the Tuscan gulf, burning with a violent 
explosion. There is a tradition too that a great number of 
fishes were floating about the spot, and that those who em- 
ployed them for food immediately expired. It is said that 
the Pithecusan isles rose up, in the same way, in the bay 
of Campania, and that, shortly afterwards, the mountain 
Epopos, from which flame had suddenly burst forth, was 
reduced to the level of the neighbouring plain. In the same 
island, it is said, that a town v.as sunk in the sea ; that in

geologists tend to confirm the opinion of the volcanic origm of many of

island existed previous to the date here assigned to it ; Lemaire, i. 412,

the part of the author, but it is, at tliis time, impossible to determiae 
what part of it was derived from ancient traditions and what fi'om the 
fertile stores of his own imagination. It is referred to by various ancient 
writers, among others by Strabo. See also the remarks of Brotier in 
Lemaire, i. 416, 417.

But let us say no more of earthquakes and of whatever 
may be regarded as the sepulchres of cities**; let us rather 
speak of the wonders of the earth than of the crimes of 
nature. But, by Hercules ! the history of the heavens them- 
selves would not be more difficult to relate : — the abundance 
of metals, so various, so rich, so prolific, rising up^ during so 
many ages ; when, throughout all the world, so much is, 
every day, destroyed by fire, by waste, by shipwreck, by 
wars, and by frauds ; and while so much is consumed by 
luxury and by such a number of people : — the figures on 
gems, so multiplied in their forms ; the variously-coloured 
spots on certain stones, and the whiteness of others, excluding 
everything except light : — the virtues of medicinal springs, 
and the perpetual fires bursting out in so many places, for 
so many ages : — the exhalation of deadly vapours, either 
emitted from caverns^, or from certain unhealthy districts ; 
some of them fatal to birds alone, as at Soracte, a district 
near the city-^ ; others to all animals, except to man^, while

cun'ing " pluribus Italiae locis ; " it may be ascribed to the exhalations from 
volcanos being raised up into the atmosphere. It does not appear tliat 
there is, at present, any cavern in Mount Soracte which emits mephitic 
vapours. But the circumstance of Soracte being regarded sacred to 
Apollo, as we leani fi-om our author, vii. 2, and from Virgil, yEn. xi. 785, 
may lead us to conjecture that something of the kind may fonnerly have 
existed there.

others are so to man also, as in the country of Sinuessa and 
Puteoli. They are generally called vents, and, by some 
persons, Cliaron's sewers, from their exhaling a deadly 
vapour. Also at Amsanctum, in the country of the Hirpini, 
at the temple of Mepliitis\ there is a place which kills all 
those who enter it. And the same takes place at Hierapolis in 
Asia"^, where no one can enter with safety, except the priest 
of the great Mother of the Gods. In other places there are 
prophetic caves, w^here those who are intoxicated with the 
vapour which rises from them predict future events^, as at 
the most noble of all oracles, Delphi. In which cases, what 
mortal is there who can assign any other cause, than the 
divine power of nature, which is everyw^here diffused, and 
thus bursts forth in various places ? 

CHAP. 96. (94.)— OF CERTAIN LANDS WHICH ARE ALWAYS 
SHAKING, AND OF FLOATING ISLANDS. 

There are certain lands which shake wlien any one passes 
over them'* ; as in the territory of the Gabii, not far from the 
city of Home, there are about 200 acres which shake when 
cavalry passes over it : the same thing takes place at Eeate. 

(95.) There are certain islands which are alw^ays floating ^, 
as in the territory of the CsBcubum^, and of the above-men- 
tioned Eeate, of Mutina, and of Statonia. In the lake of 
Vadimonis and the waters of Cutiliae there is a dark wood, 
which is never seen in the same place for a day and a night 
together. In Lydia, the islands named Calaminse are not 

whei'e, in consequence of a stratum of carbonic acid gas, which, occupies 
the lower part of the cave only, dogs and other animals, whose mouths 
are near the ground, are instantly sviifocated.

pleasure from place to place, by poles : many citizens saved 
themselves by this means in the Mithridatic war. There are 
some small islands in the Kymphaeus, called the Dancers \ 
because, when choruses are sung, they are moved by the 
motions of those who beat time. In the great Italian lake of 
Tarquinii, tliere are two islands ^\ii\l groves on them, which 
are di'iven about by the wind, so as at one time to exhibit 
the figure of a triangle and at another of a circle ; but they

COLLECTED TOGETHER. 

IS^ear Harpasa, a to^^^l of Asia, there stands a terrific rock, 
which may be moved by a single finger ; but if it be pushed 
by the force of the ^^-hole body, it resists"*. In the Tauric 
peninsula, in the state of the Parasini, there is a kind of 

^ "Saltuares." In some of the MSS. the term here employed is 
Saharcs, or Saltares ; but in all the editions which I am in the habit of 
consulting, it is Saltuares. 

^ There is, no doubt, some truth in these accoiuits of floating islands, 
although, as we may presume, much exaggerated. There are fi-equently 
small portions of land detaclied from the edges of lakes, by floods or 
rapid currents, held together and rendered buoyant by a mass of roots 
and vegetable matter. In the lake of Kes-vnck, in the county of CXun- 
berland, there are two small floating islands, of a few yards in circum- 
fej-ence, wliich are moved about by the wind oi' by currants ; they appear 
to consist, principally, of a mass of vegetable fibres. 

3 It has been observed, that there are certain places where bodies 
remain for a long time without imdergoing decomposition ; it depends 
principally upon a diy and cool condition of the air, such as is occa- 
sionally found hi vaults and natural caverns. See the reuiarks of 
Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 424. 

■* We may conceive of a large mass of rock being so balanced upon the 
fine point of another rock, as to be moved by the slightest touch ; but, 
that if it be pushed with any force, it may be thrown upon a plane sui'- 
Ikce, and will then remain immovable.

Sarcophagus^. There are two mountains near the river 
Indus ; the nature of one is to attract iron, of the other to 
repel it : hence, if there be nails in the shoes, the feet cannot 
be drawn oif the one, or set down on the other^. It has 
been noticed, that at Locris and Crotona, there has never 
been a pestilence, nor have they ever suffered from an earth- 
quake ; in Ljcia there are always forty calm days before an 
earthquake. In the territory of Argyripa the corn which is 
sown never springs up. At the altars of Mucins, in the 
country of the Yeii, and about Tusculum, and in the Cim- 
merian Forest, there are places in which things that are 
pushed into the ground cannot be pulled out again. The 
hay which is growTi in Crustuminium is noxious on tlie spot, 
but elsewhere it is wholesome ^ 

CHAP. 99. (97.) CONCEENIlfG THE CAUSE OE THE rLOWIF&amp; 

AISTD EBBINa OF THE SEA. 

Much has been said about the nature of waters ; but the 
most wonderful circumstance is the alternate flowing and 
ebbing of the tides, which exists, indeed, under various forms, 
but is caused by the sun and the moon. The tide flows 
twice and ebbs twice between each two risings of the moon,

absorbent or astrmgent properties, Hke the Terra Sigillata or Armenian 
Eole of the old Pharmacopoeias.

contained a portion of an acrid ingredient, pei'haps of an alkahne natm-e,

not appear that the material of which the stone coffins are composed, to 
which tliis name has been apphed, the workmanslnp of wliich is so much 
an object of admiration, are any of them possessed of this propei'ty. 

3 Alexandre rejnarks on this statement, " Montes istae videntur ori- 
ginem dechsse fabulae quae in Arabicis Noctibus legitvir . . . . ;" Lemaire, 
i. 425. Fouche, indeed, observes, that there are mountams composed 
principally of natural loadstone, which might sensibly attract a shoe 
containmg iron nails. Ajasson, ii. 386. But I conceive that we have no 
evidence of the existence of the magnetic iron pyrites having ever been 
found in sufficient quantity to produce any sensible effect of the kind 
here described.

chapter, the greatest part are entirely without foundation, and the I'e-

Cliap. 99.] CAUSE OF THE TIDES. 125 

always in the space of twenty-four hours. First, the moon 
rising with the stars ^ swells out the tide, and after some time, 
having gained the summit of the heavens, she declines from 
the meridian and sets, and the tide subsides. Again, after she 
has set, and moves in the heavens under the earth, as she 
approaches the meridian on the opposite side, the tide flows 
in ; after which it recedes until she again rises to us. But 
the tide of the next day is never at the same time with that of 
the preceding ; as if the planet was in attendance^, greedily 
drinkiug up the sea, and continually rising in a different place 
from what she did the day before. The intervals are, however, 
equal, being always of six hours ; not indeed in respect of any 
particular day or niglit or place^, but equinoctial hoiu's, and 
therefore they are unequal as estimated by the length of com.- 
mon hours, since a greater number of them"^ fall on some cer- 
tain days or nights, and they are never equal everywhere 
except at the equinox. This is a great, most clear, and even 
divine proof of the dullness of those, who deny that the stars 
go below the earth and rise up again, and that nature pre- 
sents the same face in the same states of their rising and 
setting^ ; for the course of the stars is equally obvious in the 
one case as in the other, producing the same effect as when 
it is manifest to the sight. 

There is a difference in the tides, depending on the moon, 
of a complicated nature, and, first, as to the period of seven 
days. For the tides are of moderate height from the new 
moon to the ffrst quarter ; from this time they increase, and 
are the highest at the full: they then decrease. On the 
seventh day they are equal to what they were at the first

quarter, and iliej again increase from the time tliat she is at 
first quarter on the other side. At her conjunction with 
the sun they are equally high as at the full. IVhen the 
moon is in the northern hemisphere, and recedes further 
from the earth, the tides are lower than when, going towards 
the south, she exercises her influence at a less distance \ 
After an interval of eight years, and the hundredth revolu- 
tion of the moon, the periods and the heights of the tides 
return into the same order as at first, this planet always 
acting upon them; and all these effects are like^^ase in- 
creased by the annual changes of the sun^, the tides rising 
up higher at the equinoxes, and more so at the autumnal 
than at the vernal ; while they are lower^ about the winter \ 
solstice, and still more so at the summer solstice ; not 
indeed precisely at the points of time which I have men- 
tioned, but a few days after'' ; for example, not exactly at 
the full nor at the new moon, but after them ; and not 
immediately when the moon becomes visible or invisible, or 
has advanced to the middle of her course, but generally 
about two hours later than the equinoctial hours^ ; the eliect 
of what is going on in the heavens being felt after a short 
interval ; as we observe with respect to lightning, thunder, 
and thunderbolts. 

But the tides of the ocean cover greater spaces and produce 
greater inundations than the tides of the other seas ; whether 
it be that the whole of the universe taken together is more 
full of life than its individual parts, or that tlie large open 
space feels more sensibly the power of the planet, as it moves 
freely about, than when restrained within narrow bounds. 

^ It is scarcely necessary to remark, that both the alleged fact and tlie 
supposed cause are incorrect. And tliis is the case with what our author 
says in the next sentence, respecthag the period of eight years, and the 
hundi'ed revolutions of the moon.

On Avhich account neither lakes nor rivers are moved in the 
same manner. Pytheas^ of Massilia informs us, that in 
Britain the tide rises 80 cubits'. Inland seas are enclosed 
as in a harbour, but, in some parts of them, there is a more 
free space which obeys the influence^. Among many other 
examples, the force of the tide will carry us in three days 
from Italy to Utica, when the sea is tranquil and there is no 
impulse from the sails^. But these motions are more felt 
about the shores than in the deep parts of the seas, as in the 
body the extremities of the veins feel the pulse, which is the 
vital spirit^ more than the other parts ^. And in most estu- 
aries, on account of the unequal rising of the stars in each 
tract, the tides diifer from each other, but this respects the 
period, not the nature of them ; as is the case in the Syrtes.

There are. However, some tides which are of a peculiar 
nature, as in the Tauromenian Euripus'^, where the ebb and 
flow is more frequent than in other places, and in Euboea, 
where it takes place seven times during the day and the 
night. The tides intermit three times during each month, 
being the 7th, 8th and 9th day of the moon'. At Gades, 
which is very near the temple of Hercules, there is a spring

or certain parts of it. See the remarks of Ilardouin in Lemaire.

of the blood-vessels, and the cause of the pulse, which were universally

ocean, and, at other times, in both respects contrary to it. 
In the same place there is another well, which always agrees 
with the ocean. On the shores of the Bajtis^ there is a town 
where the wells become lower when the tide rises, and fill 
again when it ebbs ; while at other tim^es they remain sta- 
tionary. The same thing occurs in one Avell in the town of 
Hispalis", while there is nothing peculiar in the other wells.

periods. At Messina and My las a refuse matter, like dung^, 
is cast up on the shore, whence originated the story of the 
oxen of the Sun having had their stable at that place. To 
what has been said above (not to omit anything with which 
I am acquainted) Aristotle adds, that no animal dies except 
when the tide is ebbing. The observation has been often 
made on the ocean of Gaul ; but it has only been found true 
with respect to man*'.

however, no relation to the tide, but depends upon the quantity of water 
transmitted into the Euxine by the numerous large rivers that empty 
themselves into it. 

^ It has been suggested, with some plausibility, that the greater height 
of the tides at this period will cause a greater quantity of matter to be 
cast on shore. This circumstance is referred to by Seneca, Nat. Qusest.

■tmjustly regarded as the star of oiir lifeV This it is that 
replenishes the earth^ ; when she approaches it, she fills all 
bodies, while, when she recedes, she empties them. From 
this cause it is that shell-fish grow ^dth her increase^, and 
that those animals which are without blood more particularly 
experience her influence ; also, that the blood of man is 
increased or diminished in proportion to the quantity of her 
light ; also that the leaves and vegetables generally, as I shall 
describe in the proper place"*, feel her influence, her power 
penetrating all things. 

CHAP. 103. (100.) THE POWER OF THE STJiSr. 

Fluids are dried up by the heat of the sun ; we have 
therefore regarded it as a masculine star, burning up and 
absorbing everything^. 

CHAP. 104. WHY THE SEA IS SALT. 

Hence it is that the widely-diffused sea is impregnated 
with the flavoui' of salt, in consequence of what is sweet and 
mild being evaporated from it, which the force of fire easily 
accomplishes ; while all the more acrid and thick matter is 
left behind ; on which account the water of the sea is less 
salt, at some depth than at the surface. And this is a more 
true cause of the acrid flavour, than that the sea is the con- 
tinued perspiration of the land^, or that the greater part of 
the dry vapour is mixed with it, or that the nature of the 
earth is such that it impregnates the waters, and, as it were, 

^ "Spiritus sidus ;" "Quod ritalem humorem ac spii'itus in corpo- 
ribus rebusque ommbvis varie temperet." Hardouiii in Lemaire, i. 433. 

2 " Terras satnret ; " as Alexandre interprets it, " sueco impleat ; " 
Lemaire. 

2 This circumstance is alluded to by Cicero, De Divin. ii. 33, and by 
Horace, Sat. ii. 4, 30. It is difficult to conceive how an opinion so 
totally unfounded, and so easy to refute, should have obtauied general 
credence. * Lib. xviii. chap. 75. 

^ Aristotle, Meteor, ii. 1, remarks, that as the sun is continually eva- 
porating the water of the sea, it must eventually be entirely di'ied up. 
But we have reason to bcheve, that aU tl\e water wliich is evaporated by 
the solar heat, or any other natural process, is again deposited m the form 
of rain or dew.

medicates tliem^ Among the prodigies wliich have occurred, 
there is one which happened when Dionysius, the tyrant of 
Sicily, was expelled from his kingdom ; that, for the space 
of one day, the water in the harbour became sweet. 

(101.) The moon, on the contrary, is said to be a feminine 
and delicate planet, and also nocturnal ; also that it resolves 
humours and draws them out, but does not carry them off. 
It is manifest that the carcases of wild beasts are rendered 
putrid by its beams, that, during sleep, it draws up the 
accumulated torpor into the head, that it melts ice, and 
relaxes all things by its moistening spirit-. Thus the 
changes of nature compensate each other, and are always 
adequate to their destined purpose ; some of them congealing 
the elements of the stars and others dissolving them. The 
moon is said to be fed by fresh, and the sun by salt water. 

CHAP. 105. (102.) — WHEKE THE SEA IS THE DEEPEST. 

Fabianus^ informs us that the greatest depth of the sea is 
15 stadia-*. We learn from others, that in the Euxine, 
opposite to the nation of the Coraxi, at what is called the 
Depths of the Euxine^ about 300 stadia^ from the main land, 
the sea is immensely deep, no bottom having been found. 

^ The commentators discuss at considerable length the relative merits 
of the three hypotheses here proposed, to accoimt for the saltness of the 
ocean ; all of which are equally unfounded. See Hardouin in Lemaire, 
i. 434, 435. Aristotle's opinion on this subject is contained in his Meteor. 

2 It is not easy to ascertain the origin of the very general opinion re- 
specting the pecuhar physical action of the moon. The alleged facts are, 
for the most part, without foundation, and I am not aware of any cir- 
cumstance which could, originally, have made them a part of the popular 
creed of so many nations, ancient as well as modem. Perhaps some of 
the effects which have been ascribed to the specific action of the moon, 
may be explained by the lower temperature and greater dampness of the 
air, during the absence of the sun. 

3 There appears to be some doubt respecting the history of the person 
liere referred to : according to the account of Hardouin, Fabianus was a 
naturahst, who enjoyed a high repution ; he Hved in the time of Tiberius : 
see Lemaire, i. 188. 

^ This would be a depth of 3125 yards, not very far short of two

EIYERS. 

It is very remarkable that fresh water should burst out 
close to the sea, as from pipes. But there is no end to the 
wonders that are connected with the nature of waters. Fresh 
water floats on sea water, no doubt from its being lighter ; 
and therefore sea water, which is of a heavier nature \ sup- 
ports better what floats upon it. And, in some places, 
difterent kinds of fresh water float upon each other ; as that 
of the river which falls into the Fucinus ; that of the Addua 
into the Larius ; of the Ticinus into the Yerbanus ; of the 
Mincius into the Benacus ; of the Ollius into the Sevinus ; 
and of the Rhone into the Leman lake^ (this last being 
beyond the Alps, the others in Italy) : all which rivers passing 
through the lakes for many miles, generally carry oflf no more 
water than they bring with them. The same thing is said to 
occur in the Orontes, a river of Syria, and in many others 

Some rivers, from a real hatred of the sea, pass under it, 
as does Arethusa, a foimtain of S\Tacuse, in which the sub- 
stances are found that are thrown into the Alpheus ; which, 
after flowing by Olympia, is discharged into the sea, on the 
shore of the Peloponnesus^. The Lycus in Asia^, the Era-

saline contents of the water of the Enghsh Channel are stated to be 27 grs, 
in 1000. Turner's Chem. p. 1289, 1290. 

2 The modern names of the rivers and lakes here mentioned are the 
Liris, communicating with the Lago di Celano ; the Adda, with the Lago 
di Como ; the Ticino, with the Lago Maggiore ; the Mincio, with the 
Lago di Guarda ; the Ogho, with the Lago di Sero ; and the Rhone with 
the Lake of Geneva. There may be some foundation for the alloged fact, 
because the specific gravity and the temperature of the lake may difier a 
httle from that of the river which passes tlirough it. 

•'' According to Brotier, " fons ille olim nobihssimus, nunc ignobile 
est lavacrum, cujus aqua marino saporc inficitur." He conceives that 
there is no actual foundation for this so frequently re]ieated story ; and 
conjectures that it originated from the similitude of the names, the 
fountain in Sicily and the river in the Peloponnesus being both named 
Alpheus. He goes on to mention some examples of springs of fresh 
water rising up on the sea-coast ; Lemaire, i. 438. The allusion to the 
fountain of Arethusa, by Virgil, in the commencement of the 10th eclogue, 
is weU known to all classical scholars. Tlie lines of Yirgil have been 
elegantly imitated by Voltaire, in tlie Hcnriade, ix. 269, 270.

into tlie fountain of ^sculapius at Athens^ are cast up at 
the fountain of Phalerum. The river which sinks into the 
ground in the plain of Atinum^ comes up again at the 
distance of twenty miles, and the Timavus does the same 
m Aquileia^ 

In the lake Asplialtites, in Judsea, which produces bitumen, 
no substance will sink, nor in the lake Arethusa^ in the 
Greater Armenia : in this lake, although it contains nitre

town of Mandui'ia, there is a lake« full to the brim, the 
waters of which are never diminished by what is taken out 
of it, nor increased by what is added. Wood, which is 
thrown into the river of the Cicones^ or into the lake Yelinus 
m Picenum, becomes coated with a stony crust, while in the 
Sarins, a river of Colchis, the whole substance becomes as 
hard as stone. In the same manner, in the Silarus^ beyond

3 The river here refen-ed to is the Tanager, the modern Eio Negro. See 
the remarks of Hardouin and Alexandi-e m Lemaire, i. 439. 

^ From a note in Pomsinet, i. 302, we learn that there has been some 
dgubt respectmg the locahty of this river. It is mentioned by Virgil 
Mn. 1 244, and it forms the subject of Heyne's 7th Excursus, ii. 124 el 
seq. ^ u'gil also speaks of the Tunavus, Ec. viii. 6 ; and Heyne, in a note 
gives the toUowmg description of it : " Timavus in ora Adriee, non longe 
ab Aqmleia fluvius ex terra novem fontibus seu capitibus progressus 
brevi cursu, m unum alveimi coUectus, lato altoque flumine in mare 
exit." i. 127, 128. 

5 This remark is not to be taken in its fuU extent ; the water of these 
lakes contams a large quantity of sahne and other substances dissolved 
in It, and, consequently, has its specific gravity so much increased, that 
various substances float on it whicli sink m pure water. 

6 According to Hardouin, tliis is now caUed the Lake of Andoria, near 
the town of Casahiuovo ; Lemaire, i. 439. Poinsmet caUs it Anduria

313, 314 ; Seneca quotes these Imes when treating on tliis subject Nat 
Quajst. iii. 20. j &gt; • 

8 Ai'istotle, Strabo, and Silius Itahcus, viii. 582, 583, refer to this pro- 
perty of the SHarus ; but, accordmg to Brotier, it does not appear to be 
known to tlie present inliabitants of the district thi-ough which it flows.

Suirentum, not only twigs wliieli are immersed in it, but 
likewise leaves are petrified; the Avater at the same time 
being proper for drinking. In the stream ^^hich runs from 
the marsh of Eeate^ there is a rock, which continues to 
increase in size, and in the Red Sea olive-trees and green 
shrubs are produced". 

There are many springs which are remarkable for their 
warmth. This is the case even among the ridges of the 
Alps^, and in the sea itself, between Italy and ^^naria, as in 
the bay of Baiae, and in the Liris and many other rivers'*. 
There are many places in which fresh water may be procured 
from the sea, as at the Chelidonian Isles, and at xlrados, and 
in the ocean at Grades. Green plants are produced in the 
■warm springs of Padua, frogs in those of Pisa, and fish in 
those of Yetulonia in Etruria, which is not far from the sea. 
In Casinas there is a cold river called Scatebra, which in sum- 
mer is more full of water^. In this, as in the river Stymphalis, 
in Arcadia, small water-mice are produced. The fountain 
of Jupiter in Dodona, although it is as cold as ice, and 
extinguishes torches that are plunged into it, yet, if they be 
brought near it, it kindles them again^. This spring always 
becomes dry at noon, from which circumstance it is called 

In a subsequent part of the work, xxxi. 8, our author remarks, 
" Keatinis tantum pahxchbus ungulas jvuuentorum indurari." We may 
presume that the water contained some sahne, earthy or metallic substance, 
either in solution, or in a state of minute division, which would produce 
these effects. It does not appear that anything of this kuid has been 
obsei'ved by the modems in this water. 

2 The coral beds with wliich the Red Sea abounds may have, given 
rise to this opmion : see the remarks of Alexandi-e in loco. Hardouiu 
informs us, that this clause respecting the Red Sea is not found in any 
oftheMSS. Lemaire, i. 441. A similar observation occm-s in a subse- 
quent part of the work, xiii. 48. 

3 There are thermal springs in the Alpine valleys, but not any in tlie 
elevated parts of the Alps themselves. 

4 The volcanic nature of a large portion of the south of Italy and the 
neighbouring islands may be regarded as the cause of the warm sprmgs 
which arc found there. 

* This river may be supposed to have been principally siipplied by 
melted snow ; it would appear to be colder, bccaiisc its temperalm'e would 
be less elevated than the other streams in tlie neighbourliood. 

^ The statement, if correct, may be referred to (lie discharge of a quan- 
tity of intlammable gas from the surface of the water. TLo fact is meu- 
tioned by Lucretius, vi. 879, 880, and by Mela.

springs, which increase and decrease at the same time with 
the tides of the sea\ In the territory of Pitinum, on the 
other side of the Apennines, the river Novamis, Avhich 
during the solstice is quite a torrent, is dry in the winter-. 

In Faliscum, all the water which the oxen di'ink turns 
them white; in Boeotia, the river Melas turns the sheep 
black ; the Cephissus, which flows out of a lake of the same 
name, turns them white^ ; again, the Peneus turns them 
black, and the Xanthus, near Ilium, makes them red, whence 
the river derives its name'*. In Pontus, the river Astaces 
waters certain plains, where the mares give black milk, which 
the people use in diet. In E-eate there is a spring called 
ISTeminia, which rises up sometimes in one place and sometimes 
in another, and in this way indicates a change in the produce 
of the earth^. There is a spring in the Harbour of Brundisiuui 
tliat yields water which never becomes putrid at sea. The 
water of the Lyncestis, which is said to be acidulous, intoxi- 
cates like wine^ ; this is the case also in Paphlagonia' and in 
the territory of Calenum^. In the island of Andi^os, at the 
temple of Father Bacchus, we are assured by Mucianus, 
who was thrice consul, that there is a spring, which, on the 
nones of January, always has the flavour of wine ; it is called 

' Hardouin informs us, that these warm springs are called " i bagni di 
Monte Falcone," or " di S. Antonio." They are situate so very near the 
sea, that we may suppose some communication to exist, which may pro- 
duce the alleged effect. Lemaire. 

' 2 According to Hardouin this is the modem Torre di Pitino ; he con- 
ceives that the river here mentioned niust be the Vomanus. The effect 
here described is, to a certain extent, always the case with rivers wliich 
proceed from mountains that are covered with snow. Lemaire, i. 445. 

3 Seneca, Nat. Quaest. iii. 25, makes the same remark : the fact would 
Beem to be, that in certain districts the cattle are found to be for the most 
part white, and in other places black ; but we have no reason to suppose 
that their colour has any connexion with the water wliich they emjiloy. 

4 This is asserted by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. iii. 12. We have a similar 
statement made by ^han respecting the Scamander ; viii. 21.

^ The peculiar natvu-e of the water of the Lyncestis is rcfeiTcd to by 
many of the ancients : we may suppose that it was strongly impregnated 
with carbonic acid gas. See Ovid, Met. xv. 329-331 ; also Arittotle,

Atos Qeodncria\ Near Nonacris, in Arcadia, tlie Styx^, which' 
is not unlike it either in odour or in colour, instantly de- 
stroys those who drink it. Also in Librosus, a hill in the 
country of the Tauri, there are three springs which inevi- 
tably produce death, but without pain. In the territory 
of the Carrinenses in Spaing two springs burst out close 
together, the one of which absorbs everything, the other 
throws them out. In the same country there is another 
spring, which gives to all the fish the appearance of o-old, 
although, when out of the water, they do not differ in^any 
respect from other fish. In the territory of Como, near the 
Larian lake, there is a copious spring, which always swells 
up and subsides again every hour\ In the island of Cydo- 
nea^ before Lesbos, there is a warm fountain, which flows 
only during the spring season. The lake Sinnaus*', in Asia, 
is nnpreguated with wormwood, which grows about it. At 
Colophon, in the cave of the Clarian Apollo, there is a pool 
by the drinking of which a power is acquired of uttering 
wonderful oracles ; but the lives of those who drink of it are 
shortened^ In our own times, during the last years of 
Nero's life, we have seen rivers flowing backwards, as I have 
stated in my history of his times ^.

^ Tliis is an erroneous statement ; it is not easy to ascertain what was 
the som*ce of the error. 

' Rain, as it falls from the clouds, is nearly pure ; and rivers, or recep- 
tacles of any kind, that are supphed by it, are considerably more free from 
saline impregnations than the generality of springs. 

8 This statement is altogether incorrect. 

9 When salt water fi-eezes, it is disengaged from the saline matter wliich 
it previously held in solution ; a greater degree of cold is therefore re- 
quired to overcome the attraction of the water for the salt, and to fonn 
the ice, than when pvu'C water is congealed.

In Samosata, a city of Commagene^ there is a pool which

be longer in becoming raised or depressed than any particular portion 
of the land, where contemporary observations may be made. 

1 The evaporation that is going on dm-mg the heats of summer, and 
the heavy rams which m many countries faU during the autunm, may 
produce the effects here described, m confined seas or inlets.. 

2 The statement is true to a certain extent, as is proved by the well- 
known experiments of Franklin and others ; but the degree of the effect 
is considerably exaggerated. See the observations of Hardouin, Brotier 
and Alexandre ; Lemaire, i. 450, 451. ' 

3 In the Mediterranean the warm vapours risuig from the water and 
Its shores may melt the snow as it descends ; but this is not the case in 
the parts of the main ocean which approach either to the Ai^ctic or the 
Antarctic regions. 

■» The theory of springs is well understood, as depending upon the 
water tending to rise to its original level, so as to produce an equihbriimi 
of pressure. 

5 When we consider the great extent of the base of ^tna, and that 
the crater is in the form of an inverted cone, we shall perceive that there 
is ample space for the existence of springs m the lower part of the moun- 
tam, without their coming in contact with the heated lava.

essentially from the Maltha of the last chapter, except in being of a more 
fluid consistence. 

3 The Astaceni are supposed to have inhabited a district near the

that this lire is kindled by water, while it is extinguished

mountains of Hephasstius, when touched with a flaming 
torch'', burn so violently, that even the stones in the river 
and the sand burn, while actually in the water : this fire is 
also increased by rain. If a person makes furrows in the 
ground with a stick which has been kindled at this fire, it 
is said that a stream of flame will follow it. The summit of 
Cophantus, in Bactria'', burns during the night ; and this is 
the case in Media and at Wittacene^, on the borders of Per- 
sia ; likewdse in Susa, at the White Tower, from fifteen aper- 
tures*^, the greatest of which also burns in the da}i:ime. 
The plain of Babylon throws up flame from a place like a fish- 
pond', an acre in extent. Near Hesperium, a mountain of 
the Ethiopians', the fields shine in the night-time like stars ; 
the same thing takes place in the territory of the Megalopo- 

that the number of extinct volcanos is considerably greater tlian those 
now in action. 

^ Cliimsera was a volcano in Lycia, not far fi'om the Xanthus ; the 
cii'cumstance of its summit emitting flame, while its sides were the resort 
of various savage animals, probably gave rise to the fabulous story of the 
Centaur of this name, a ferocious monster who was continually vomitmg 
forth flame.

of Apollonian It is increased by rain'\ and it throws out 
bitumen, which, becoming mixed with the fountain, renders 
it unfit to be tasted ; it is, at other times, the weakest of all 
the bitumens. But what are these compared to other 
wonders ? Hiera, one of the JEoHan isles, in the middle of 
the sea, near Italy, together with the sea itself, during the 
Social war, burned for several days^ until expiation was 
made, by a deputation from the senate. There is a hiU in 
-Ethiopia called Qewi' oxf?^a', which burns with the greatest 
violence, throwing out flame that consumes everything, Hke 
the sun^. In so many places, and with so many fires, does 
nature burn the earth !

2 If tliis account be not altogetlier fabulous, the appearance here de- 
scribed may be, perhaps, referred to the combustion of an inflammable 
gas which does not acquire a very high temperature.

already referred to it in the 96th chapter of this book, as a pool or lake, 
containing floating islands ; and he agam speaks of it in the next chapter.

It would appear, however, that it had ceased to emit flame previous to 
the calamitous events of which it was supposed to be the harbmger.

conceive that a sudden influx of water might force up an imusually large 
quantity of the bitumen.

of the earth ^ ? "Wliat must be the nature of that thing, 
which, in all parts of the world, supplies this most greedy 
voracity without destroying itself? To these fires must be 
added those innumerable stars and the great sun itself. There 
are also the fires made by men^, those which are innate in 
certain kinds of stones, those produced by the friction of 
wood^ and those in the clouds, which give rise to lightning. 
It really exceeds all other wonders, that one single day 
should pass in which everything is not consumed, especially 
when we reflect, that concave mirrors placed opposite to the 
sun's rays produce flame more readily than any other kind of 
fire ; and that numerous small but natural fires abound every- 
where. In Nymphssum there issues from a rock a fire which 
is kindled by rain ; it also issues from the waters of the Scan- 
tia". This indeed is a feeble flame, since it passes ofi", re- 
maining only a short time on any body to which it is applied : 
an ash tree, which overshadows this fiery spring, remains 
always green". In the territory of Mutina fire issues from 
the ground on the days that are consecrated to Vulcan^, 
It is stated by some authors, that if a burning body falls 
on the fields below Aricia'', the ground is set on fire ; and 
that the stones in the territory of the Sabines and of the 
Sidicini^, if they be oiled, burn with flame. In Egnatia^, a

2 " Humani ignes," according to Hardouin, " Hi nostri ignes, quos vit£B 
usus requirit, ut Tullius ait de Nat. Deor. ii. 67 ;" Lemaire, i. 457. 

3 This is the mode which many savage tribes employ for exciting flame. 
■* It is not known whether the Scantia was a river or a lake, or where 

it was situated ; see Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 457. 

^ This may have been owing to the emission of an inflammable gas 
which burns at a comparatively low temperature, as was observed on a 
former occasion. 

6 These are said by Columella, xi. 3, to occm* in August ; the state- 
ment as to the fire occurrmg on these pai-ticular days we may presume 
is erroneous. 

7 Aricia was a town in Campania, near the modern Lake of Nemi : 
this place, as well as the other places mentioned by our author, were 
probably of volcanic origin.

the modern Teano.

town of Saleutinum, there is a sacred stone, upon which, when 
wood is placed, flame immediately bursts forth. lu the altar 
of Juno Lacinia\ which is in the open air, the ashes remain 
unmoved, although the winds may be blowing from all 
quarters. 

It appears also that there are sudden fires both in waters 
and even in the human body ; that the whole of Lake Thra- 
symenus was on fire' ; that when ServiusTullius, while a child, 
was sleepiug, flame darted out from his head^' ; and Valerius 
Antias informs us, that the same flame appeared about L. 
Marcius, when he was pronouncing the funeral oration over 
the Scipios, who were killed in apain ; and exhorting the 
soldiers to avenge their death. I shall presently mention 
more facts of this nature, and in a more distinct manner ; in 
this place these wonders are mixed up with other subjects. 
But my mind, having carried me beyond the mere interpre- 
tation of nature, is anxious to lead,* as it were by the hand, 
the thoughts of my readers over the whole globe. 

CHAP. 112. (108.) — THE DIMENSIONS OF THE EARTH. 

Our part of the earth, of which I propose to give an ac- 
count, floating as it were in the ocean which surrounds it 
(as I have mentioned above"), stretches out to the greatest 
extent from east to west, viz. from India to the Pillars con- 
secrated to Hercules at Gades, being a distance of 8568 
iniles% according to the statement of Artemidorus^ or ac- 

known lines, Sat. i. 5, 97 ; but it is not improbable that there may be 
some foundation for it. 

^ This cii-cumstance is referred to by Val. Maximus, i. 8, 18. The altar 
was probably in the neighboiirhood of the Lacinian Promontoi7, at the 
S.W. extremity of the Bay of Tarcntum, the modern Capo delle Colonne. 

' This may be referred to the inilammable vapours mentioned above, 
imlcss we regard the whole narrative as fabulous. 

3 See Livy, i. 39, and Val. Maximus, i. 6. 2. Although it would be 
rash to pronounce this occurrence and the following anecdotes respect- 
ing Marcius to be absolutely impossibk^ we must regard them as liiglily 
improbable, and resting upon very insufficient evidence.

* In the estimate of distances I have given the numbers as they occur 
in tlie text of Lemaire, although, in many cases, tliere is considerable 
doubt as to their accuracy. See the observations of llardouin and Alex- 
andre in Lemaire, i. 460.

cording to tliat of Isiclorus\ 9(S18 miles. Artemidorus adds 
to this 491 miles, from (lades, going round by the Sacred 
Promontory, to the promontory of Artabrum^, which is the 
most projecting part of Spain. 

This measurement may be taken in two directions. From 
the Granges, at its mouth, where it discharges itself into the 
Eastern ocean, passing through India and Parthyene, to 
Myriandrus^, a city of Syria, in the bay of Issus, is a di- 
stance of 5215 miles ^. Thence, going directly by sea, by the 
island of Cyprus, Patara in Lycia, Rhodes, and Astypalaea, 
islands in the Carpathian sea, by Tsenarum in Laconia, 
Lilybaeum in Sicily and Calaris in Sardinia, is 2103 miles. 
Thence to Grades is 1250 miles, making the whole distance 
from the Eastern ocean 8568 miles ^. 

The other way, which is more certain, is chiefly by land. 
Erom the Granges to the Euphrates is 5169 miles ; thence to 
Mazaca, a town in Cappadocia, is 319 miles ; thence, through 
Phrygia and Caria, to Ephesus is 415 miles ; from Ephesus, 
across the ^Egean sea to Delos, is 200 miles ; to the Isthmus 
is 212|- miles ; thence, first by land and afterwards by the 
sea of Lechseum and the gulf of Corinth, to Patrse in Pelopon- 
nesus, 90 miles ; to the promontory of Leucate 87^ miles ; 
as much more to Corcyra ; to the Acroceraunian mountains 
132^, to Brundisium 87^^, and to Rome 360 miles. To the 
Alps, at the village of Scingomagum^, is 519 miles ; through 
Gaul to Illiberis at the Pyrenees, 927 ; to the ocean and the

3 This was a city on the Sinus Issicus, the present Grulf of Aiasso, 
situated, according to Brotier, between the sites of the modern towns of 
Scanderoon and Rosos. See Lemaire, i. 461. 

^ Respecting this and the otlier distances mentioned in this chapter, I 
may refer the reader to the remarks of Hardouui in Lemaire, i. 461. 

^ It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the calculations of our author 
do not indicate the real distance between the extreme points of the habi- 
table parts of the globe, as known to the ancients, but the niunber of miles 
which must be passed over by a traveller, in going fi'om place to place ; 
in the first instance, a considerable part of the way by sea, and, in the 
second, almost entirely by land. 

^ It appears to be difficult to ascertain the identity of the place here 
mentioned ; I may refer to the remarks of Hardouui and Brotier in Le- 
maire, i. 464.

coast of Spain, 331 miles; across the passage of Gades 71 
miles ; which distances, according to the estimate of Arte- 
midorus, make altogether 89-45 miles. 

The breadth of the earth, from south to north, is commonlj 
supposed to be about one-half only of its length, viz. 4490 
miles ; hence it is evident how much the heat has stolen from 
it on one side and the cold on the other : for I do not sup- 
pose that the land is actually wanting, or that the earth has 
not the form of a globe ; but that, on each side, the unin- 
habitable parts have not been discovered. This measure 
then extends from the coast of the Ethiopian ocean, tlie 
most distant part which is habitable, to Meroe, 1000 miles ^ ; 
thence to Alexandi^a 1250 ; to Ehodes 562 ; to Cnidos 87^ ; 
to Cos 25 ; to Samos 100 ; to Chios 94 ; to Mitylene 65 ; to 
Tenedos 44 ; to the promontory of Sigseum 12| ; to the en- 
trance of the Euxine 312^ ; to the promontory of Carambis 
350 ; to the entrance of the Pains Maeotis 312^ ; and to the 
mouth of the Tanais 275 miles, which distance, if we went 
by sea, might be shortened 89 miles. Beyond the Tanais 
the most diligent authors have not been able to obtain any 
accurate measurement. Artemidorus supposes that every- 
thing beyond is undiscovered, since he cordesses that, about 
the Tanais, the tribes of the Sarmatse dwell, who extend 
towards the north pole. Isidorus adds 1250 miles, as the 
distance to Thule^; but this is mere conjecture. For my 
part, I believe that the boundaries of Sarmatia really extend 
to as great a distance as that mentioned above : for if it 
were not very extensive, how coidd it contain the innume- 
rable tribes that are always changing their residence ? And 
indeed I consider the iminhabitable portion of the world to 
be still greater ; for it is well known that there are innu- 

^ The same remarks may be made upon this and the following num- 
bers as upon those in the former paragraph ; for further infonnation I 
shall refer my readers to the notes of Ilardoum, Brotier, and Alexandre, 
in Lemaire, i. 465-468. 

2 There is great uncertainty respecting the locality of the Thule of 
the ancients ; there was, in fact, nothing known respecting the locahty 
or identity of any of the places approaching to the Arctic circle ; the 
name appears to have been vaguely apphed to some country lying to the 
north of the habitable parts of Europe. In note ^, p. 109, 1 have already 
liad occasion to ofier some remarks on the locahty of Thule. Our author 
speaks of Thule in two subsequent parts of his work, iv. 30 and vL 3i).

merable islands lying off the coast of Grermany\ whicli liave 
been only lately discovered. 

The above is all that I consider worth relating about the 
length and the breadth of the earth". But Eratosthenes^, 
a man who was peculiarly well skilled in all the more subtle 
parts of learning, and in this above everything else, and a 
person whom I perceive to be approved by every one, has 
stated the whole of this circuit to be 252,000 stadia, which, 
according to the E-oman estimate, makes 31,500 miles. The 
attempt is presumptuous, but it is supported by such subtle 
argiunents that we cannot refuse oiu' assent. Hipparchus'*, 
whom we must admire, both for the ability with which he 
controverts Eratosthenes, as well as for his diligence in every- 
thing else, has added to the above number not much less 
than 25,000 stadia. 

(109.) Dionysodorus is certainly less worthy of confi- 
dence^ ; but I cannot omit this most remarkable instance of 
Grecian vanity. He was a native of Melos, and was cele- 
brated for his knowledge of geometry ; he died of old age in 
his native country. His female relations, who inherited his 
property, attended his funeral, and when they had for several 
successive days performed the usual rites, they are said to 
have found in his tomb an epistle written in his own name 
to those left above ; it stated that he had descended fi»om 
his tomb to the lowest part of the earth, and that it was a 
distance of 42,000 stadia. There were not wanting certain 
geometricians, who interpreted this epistle as if it had been 
sent from the middle of the globe, the point which is at the 
greatest distance from the surface, and which must necessarily 
be the centre of the sphere. Hence the estunate has been 
made that it is 252,000 stadia in circumference. 

^ It is probable, that these supposed "immense islands," if they were 
not entirely imaginary, were the countries of Sweden and Norway, the 
southern extremities ^lone of which had been yisited by the ancients.

chapter of this book.

book.

of Pompey agamst Cfesar, and served as his Heutenant in Spain. He 
afterwards became reconciled to Csesar, and ched in the year B.C. 26. He 
is said to have wTitten 500 volumes, but nearly all liis works are lost 
(destroyed, it is said, by order of Pope Gregory YII.). His only re- 
mains are a Treatise on Agricidtiu-e, a Treatise on the Latin Tongue, 
and the fragments of a work called Analogia. 

2 C. Sulpicius Gallus was Consul in the year 166 B.C. He wrote a 
Eoman History, and a work on the Echpscs of the Svm and Moon. 

3 Titus Vespasianus, the Emperor, to whom Pliny dedicates his work. 
His poem is mentioned in c. 22 of this Book. See pages 1, 2, and 55 of

■* It is most probable that Quintus -(Ehus Psetus Tubero is here meant. 
He was son-m-law, and, accorchng to Cicero, nephew of ^mihus Paulus, 
and Consul in the year B.C. 167. There are two other persons found 
mentioned of the name of Q. ^Ehus Tubero. 

* The freedman and amanuensis of Cicero. He was a man of great 
learning, and was supposed to have invented short-hand. He also WTote 
a Life of Cicero. 

^ Lucius Calpumius Piso Frugi. He was Consiil in the year B.C. 133, 
and was a stout opponent of the Gracclii. He wrote Annals of the History 
of Rome from the earliest periods. 

7 Livy, the well-known Roman historian. 

8 Hewas the intimate friend of Cicero,and wrote Clu'onicles or Annals, in 
three books, a Life of Cicero, and some other historical works. A work stiU 
exists, called " Lives of Eminent Commanders," wliich is ascribed some- 
times to lum and sometimes to one ^Emihus Probus, a writer of the reign 
of Theodosius. The latter probably abridged the original work of Nepoa.

He wrote a work called the " Periplus," and another on the Wonders of 
India. 

1" A Eoman historian and lawyer, who flourished about B.C. 124. He 
wrote a Book of Annals, m wliich was contained a valuable account of

the Annals of Rome, down to the time of Sylla. 

3 Marcus Licuiius Crassus Mucianus. He was instrumental in raising 
the Emperor Vespasian to the throne, and was Consul in the years 
A.D. 52, 70, and 74 He pubhshed three Books of Epistles, and a History 
m eleven Books, which appears to have treated eliiefly of Eastern aflah's.

peians in Africa, and was taken prisoner by Cgesar, but liis hfe was spared. 
Cicero wi'ote several letters to him, and commends his abilities. His 
work appears to have been on Divination as practised by the Etrm-ians.

9 A native of Nicea in Bithynia, who floui-ished B.C. 160. He is called 
the " Father" of Astronomy. He wrote a Commentary on the Pheno- 
mena of Aratus and Eudoxus, which is still extant. His works, including 
those on the Lunar Month and the Fixed Stars, have not come down to 
us. His Catalogue of the Stars is preserved in the Ahnagest of Ptolemy. 

10 Tunseus of Locri in Italy, a Pythagorean plulosopher, said to have 
been the mstructor of Plato. He wrote a work on Mathematics. A work 
" On the Soul of the World and of Nature," which is stiU extant, has 
been ascribed to liim, but on doubtful grounds. 

11 An astronomer and peripatetic philosopher of Alexandria. He was 
employed by JuHus Csesar to superintend liis revision of the Calendar, 
It is supposed that he wrote a work on the Celestial Revolutions, and a 
Commentary on the works of Ai-istotle. 

12 A priest, mathematician, and astrologer of Egypt. A Letter on 
the Astrological Sciences, written by him to King Necepsos, is said to be 
extant m the Royal Library at Vienna, as also a work called the " Orga- 
num Astrologicum," dedicated to the same king. Juvenal seems to use 
his name as a common term for an astrologer.

tion, the tides, and the nature of the gods. Some fragments only have 
survived. 

3 Of Miletus, was born B.C. 610, and was the successor of Thales, the

1 Born either at Astypalsea or iEgina. He was chief pUot of the 
fleet of Alexander duruig the descent of the Indus and the voyage to the 
Persian Gulf. He wrote a work called the " Alexandi-opsedia," or Edu- 
cation of Alexander. In his description of what he saw in India, many 
fables and falsehoods are said to have been uiterwoven, so much so that 
the work (wliich is now lost) is said to have resembled a fable more than 
a history. 

2 Of Cyrene, bom B.C. 276. He was invited from Athens by Ptolemy 
Euergetes, to become keeper of the library at Alexandria. He was a man 
of most extensive erudition, as an astronomer, geographer, philosopher, 
historian and grammarian. .Ah of his writings have perished, with the 
exception of a few fragments on geograpliical subjects. 

3 Of Massiha, now Marseilles, a celebrated navigator who floiu-ished 
about the tune of Alexander the Grreat. In his voyages he visited Britain 
and Thule, of which he probably gave some account in liis work " on the 
Ocean." He has been wrongfully accused of falsehood by Strabo. An- 
other work .written by him was his " Periplus," or ' Cfrcumnavigation' 
from Gades to the Tanais, probably, in this mstance, the Elbe.

Besides his great work which has come down to us, he is supposed to 
have written a history of Ai'abia. 

^ Probably the most learned of the Greek philosophers. His works 
were exceedingly numerous, and those which have smTived to us treat of 
natural history, metaphysics, physical science, etliics, logic, and general

Mnemon, having been made prisoner by him at the battle of Cimaxa. He 
wrote a History of Persia in 23 books, wliich, with the exception of a small 
abridgement by Photius and a few fragments, is now lost. He also wrote 
a book on India. He was much censured, probably without sufficient 
reason, for the creduhty displayed in his works.

PLES WHO NOW EXIST OR FORMERLY EXISTED. 

IlfTKODTJCTIOK. 

Thus far have I treated of the position and the ^venders of 
the earth, of the waters, the stars, and the proportion ot 
the imiverse and its dimensions. I shaU now proceed to 
describe its individual parts ; although indeed we may with 
reason iook upon the task as of an infinite nature, and one 
not to be rashly commenced upon without mcurrmg censure. 
And yet on the other hand, there is nothing which ought less 
to require an apology, if it is only considered how lar from 
surprisinff it is that a mere mortal cannot be acquainted 
with eve?}^hing. I shall therefore not follow any smgle 
author, but shall employ, in relation to each suhject, such 
writers as I shall look upon as most worthy of credit. ^ or 
indeed it is the characteristic of nearly aU ot them, that 
they display the greatest care and accuracy m the descrip- 
tion of the countries in which they respectively floui'ished; 
so that by doing this, I shall neither have to blame nor con- 
tradict any one. -n i v -^ i^ 

The names of the different places wiU here be simply 
given, and as briefly as possible; the account of their cele- 
brity and the events which have given rise thereto, bemg 
deferreu' ^o a more appropriate occasion ; for it must be 
remembered that I am here speaking of the earth as a whole, 
and I wish to be understood as using the names without any 
reference whatever to their celebrity, and as though the 
places themselves were in their infancy, and had not as yet 
acquired any fame through great events. Ihe^name is men- 
tioned, it is true, but only as iormmg a part ol the world 
and the system of the universe. . 

The whole globe is divided into three parts, Europe, Asia, 
ind Africa Our description commences where the sun sets 
and at theStraits of Gades\where the Atlantic ocean,burstmg

in, is poured forth into the inland seas. As it makes its 
entrance from that side, Africa is on the right hand and 
Europe on the left ; Asia lies between them^ ; the boundaries 
being the rivers Tanais^ and Mle. The Straits of the ocean, 
of which I have just spoken, extend fifteen miles in length and 
five^ in breadth, measured from the village of Mellaria^ in 
Spain to the Album Promontorium^ or White Promontory in 
Airica, as we learn from Turranius Grracilis, who was born in 
that vicinity. Titus Livius and Cornelius Nepos however 
have stated the breadth, where it is least, to be seven miles, 
and where greatest, ten ; from so small a mouth as this does 
so immense an expanse of water open upon us ! Nor is our 
astonishment diminished by the fact of its being of great 
depth ; for, instead of that, there are numerous breakers and 
shoals, white with foam, to strike the mariner with alarm. 
From this circumstance it is, that many have called this spot 
the threshold of The Inland Sea. 

At the narrowest part of the Straits, there are mountains 
placed to form barriers to the entrance on either side, 
Abyla*' in Africa, and Calpe'' in Europe, the boundaries 
formerly of the labours of Hercules*^. Hence it is that the 
inhabitants have called them the Columns of that god ; they 

^ This is said more especially in reference to the western parts of Asia, 
the only portion which was perfectly known to the ancients. His mean- 
ing is, that Asia as a portion of the globe does not he so far north as 
Europe, nor so far south as Afi'ica. 

2 Now the Don. It was usually looked upon as the boundary between 
Evu'ope and Asia. Phny's meaning seems to be, that the Tanais divides 
Asia from Europe, and the Nile, Asia from Africa, the more especially 
as the part to the west of the Nile was sometimes considered as belonging 
to Asia. It has been however suggested that he intends to assign these 
rivers as the extreme eastern boundaries of the internal or Mediterranean 
sea. 

3 At no spot are the Straits less than ten miles in width ; although 
D'Anville makes the width to be httle less than five miles. This passage 
of our author is probably m a corrvxpt state. 

^ This probably stood near the site of the town of Tarifa of the pre- 
sent day.

the sea, which was before excluded, gained adjuissiou, and 
so changed the face of nature. 

CHAP. 1. (1.) THE BOUISTDAEIES AND GULFS OF EUEOPE 

FIRST SET FORTH IN A GENERAL WAY. 

1 shall first then speak of Europe, the foster-mother of that 
people which has conquered all other nations, and itself by 
far the most beauteous portion of the earth. Indeed, many 
persons have, not without reason \ considered it, not as a 
third part only of the earth, but as equal to all the rest, 
looking upon the whole of oui- globe as divided into two 
parts only, by a line cba^^-n from the river Tanais to the 
Straits of Grades. The ocean, after pouring the waters of the 
Atlantic through the inlet which I have here described, and, 
in its eager progress, overwhelming all the lands which have 
had to dread its approach, skirts with its winding course the 
shores of those parts which oiFer a more efiectual resistance, 
hollowing out the coast of Eiurope especially into numerous 
bays, among wliich there are four Grulfs that are more parti- 
cularly remarkable. The first of these begins at Calpe, which 
I have previously mentioned, the most distant mountain of 
Spain ; and bends, describing an immense ciu-ve, as far as 
Locri and the Promontory of Bruttium-. 

CHAP. 2. OF SPAIN GENERALLY. 

The first land situate upon this Grulf is that which is called 
the Farther Spain or Bjetica^ ; next to which, beginning at 
the frontier to^n of TJrgi'*, is the Nearer, or TarraconCnsian^ 

' This was the opinion of Herodotus, but it had been so strenuously 
combated by Polybius and other m-iters before the time of Phny, that it 
is difficidt to imagine how he should countenance it. 

2 He probably alludes to Leucojietra, now caUed Capo dell' Anni. 
Locri Epizephyrh was a tomi of Bruttiiun, situate north of the promon- 
tory of Zephyrium, now called Capo cU Bruzztmo. 

3 So called from the Baetis, now the Guadakiuivir or Great River, 

* The situation of this tovni is not known, but it is supposed to hare 
been about five leagues from the itresent city of Mujacar, or Moxacar. 
It was situate on tlie Sinus Urgitanus.

ragona.

Spain, extending as far as tlie cliain of the Pyrenees. ^ The 
Farther Spain is divided lengthwise into two provinces, 
Lusitania^ and Baetica, the former stretching along the 
northern side of the latter, and being divided from it by the 
river Ana'^ 

The source of this river is in the district of Laminium , m 
the Nearer Spain. It first spreads out into a number of 
small lakes, and then again contracts itself into a narrow 
channel, or entirely disappears under ground^ and after 
frequently disappearing and again coming to light, finally dis- 
charges itself into the Atlantic Ocean. Tarraconensian Spain 
lies on one side, contiguous to the Pyrenees, running down- 
wards along the sides of that chain, and, stretching across from 
the Iberian Sea to the Gallic ocean^ is separated from Bsetica 
and Lusitania by Mount Solorius^ the chains of the Oretani^ 
and the Carpetani^, and that of the Astures^ 

CHAP. 3. — OP B^TICA. 

Bfetica, so called from the river which divides it in the 
middle, excels all the other provinces in the richness of its 
cultivation and the peculiar fertility and beauty of its vege- 
tation. 

It consists of four jurisdictions, those of Gades", of Cor- 
duba'\ of Astigi'-, and of Hispalis'l The total number of 
its towns is 175 ; of these nine are colonies ^^ and eight muni- 

1 Corresponding nearly in extent with the present kingdom of Portugal. 

2 Now aaudiana, a corruption of the Arabic Wadi Ana, " the riyer Ana." 

3 According to Hardouin this place is the modem town of Montiel, 
but Pmet and D'Anville make it the same as Alhambra. 

■* According to modern writers it conceals itself in this manner for a 
distance of fifteen miles. 

5 From the Balearic Channel to the Grulf of G-ascony or Bay of Biscay. 

6 Probably the Sierra Nevada is meant by this name ; Hardoum con- 
siders it the same as the Sierra de los Yertientes. 

7 Probably the Sierra Morena. ^ The Monte de Toledo. 

9 The Sierra de las Asturias. 

10 The present Cadiz. It was originally a Phoenician colony. 

" Now Cordova. ^2 j^ow Ecija. ^^ Now Seville. 

14 The Roman colonies or colonies " civium Romanorum" are those 
here meant. The colonists in such case enjoyed all the rights of Romao 
citizens, the town in wMch they lived being founded under the supervi- 
sion of the Roman magistracy. 



Chap. 3.] ACCOTJNT OF COTJISTTEIES, &amp;C. 155 

cipal towns ^ ; twentj-nine have been long since presented with 
tlie old Latin rights' ; six are free towns^, three federate^, 
and 120 tributary. 

In this district, the things that more especially deserve no- 
tice, or are more easUy explained in the Latin tongue, are the 
following, beginning at the river Ana, along the line of the sea- 
shore ; the town of Onoba, surnamed ^stuaria^ ; the rivers 
Luxia and Urium^, flowing through this territory between 
the Ana and the Ba3tis ; the Marian' Mountains ; the river 
Bsetis ; the coast of Corum^, \\dth its winding bay ; opposite 

^ " Mmiicipia." These were towns in conquered countries which were 
not founded by the Romans, but whose inhabitants retaiued their original 
institutions, at the same time receiving certain of the rights of Roman 
citizens ; most frequently, immunity to a greater or less degi'ee from 
payment of tribute. 

2 " Latiiim ;" also called " Jus Latii " and " Latinitas." This was the 
name given to those cfrcumscribed or limited rights as Roman citizens 
wliich were at fii'st bestowed upon the conquered states of Italy, before 
the time of the Social War. Indeed the Latinus held a kind of inter- 
mediate state between the Civis Romanus with aU his rights, and the 
peregrinus or foreigner with all liis disabilities. These Latin rights were 
afterwards extended to the people of other countries, but retained their 
original name. 

3 The free towns were those, the inhabitants of which were at hberty 
to enjoy their ancient institutions and modes of internal government, 
though at the same time they enjoyed none of the privileges of Roman 
citizens. 

■* " Foederati civitates ; " the inhabitants of wliich were called ' foederati' 
or ' socii.' They were in alliance with the Romans, but in some cases 
paid them tribute in the same manner as the ' stipendiaria ' next men- 
tioned. In some instances they also enjoyed the Latin rights. 

^ From the numerous creeks or a;stuaries with which the coast is here 
indented. Commentators are at a loss for the site of the town of 
Onoba (or Ossonoba accorduig to some readings). D'AnviUe considers 
it to be the same with the present town of Moguer ; other commentators 
have suggested Gibraleon, and the vicinity of Palos. 

^ The Odiel and the Tinto ; the Urium being supposed to be the same 
with the Tinto of the present day. 

7 Some readings have " Hai'eiii montes," and others " Arense montes," 
the " mountains of sand." There is no doubt that the sandy heights or 
downis on this coast are here meant, which are called at the present day 
" Dunes " by the French, and by the natives " Arenas gordas." 

s Probably the hue of sea-shore between Roia and the city of Cadiz, 
skirting the Bay of Cadiz. Hardoum however thinks that the coast 
between the Guadalquivir and the Guadalote is meant, now occupied in 
part by the town of San Lucar de Barameda.

to wliicli is Gades, of wliicli we shall have occasion to spealv 
among the islands^ Next comes the Promontory of Juno-, 
and the port of Ba^sippo^ ; the towns of Boelo'' and Mellaria". 
at which latter begin the Straits of the Atlantic ; Carteia*^^, 
called by the Grreeks Tartessos^ ; and the mountain of Calpe. 
Along the coast of the inland sea^ is the town of Barbesula" 
with its river ; also Salduba^" ; the town of SueP^ ; and then 
Malaca^^, with its river, one of the federate towns. Next to this 
comes Msenoba^^, with its river ; then Sexifirmum^^, surnamed 

^ In the Fourth Book, c. 36. ^ The present Cape Trafalgar. 

* Hardouin says that the present Vejer is the place meant, while others 
have suggested Puerto de Santa Maria, or Cantillana. Others again 
identify it with Bejer de la Frontera, though that place probably Ues too 
far inland. • The Roman ruins near IPorto Barbato were probably its site. 

* Hardouin and other commentators suggest that the site of the pre- 
sent Tarifa is here meant ; it is more probable however that D'Anville is 
right in suggesting the now deserted town of Bolonia. 

^ Probably the present Tarifa. 

^ The exact site of Carteia is imkiiown ; but it is generally supposed 
to have stood upon the bay which opens out of the straits on the west of 
the Rock of Gribraltar, now called the Bay of Algesiras or G-ibraltar ; and 
upon the hill at the head of the bay of El Rocadillo, about half-way 
between Algesiras and Gribraltar. 

7 We learn also from Strabo, that Tartessus was the same place as 
Carteia; it is not improbable that the former was pretty nearly the 
Phoenician name of the place, and the latter a Roman corruption of it, 
and that in it originated the 'Tarshish' of Scripture, an appellation 
apparently given to the whole of the southern part of the Spanish penin- 
sula. Probably the Greeks preserved the appellation of the place more 
in conformity with the original Phoenician name. 

^ By the "inland sea" Phny means the Mediterranean, in contra- 
distinction to the Atlantic Ocean without the Straits of Cadiz. 

'^ The ruuis of tlais place, probably, are still to be seen on the east bank 
of the river Guadiaro, here alluded to. 

^^ With its river flowing by it. This place is probably the present 
MarbeUa, situate on the Rio Verde. 

" Probably the present Castillo de Torremohnos, or else Castillo de 
Fuengii'ola. 

^2 The present city of Malaga. Hardouin thinks that the river Gua- 
dalquivirejo is here meant, but as that is some miles distant fi'om the city, 
it is more probable that the Guadahnedina, which is much nearer to it, 
is the stream alluded to. 

13 Not improbably Velez Malaga, upon a river of the same name. 
Hardouin thinks that the place is the modern Torrox on the Fiu Frio, j 
and D'Anville the present city of Almvmecar, on the Rio Verde. i 

" Most probably the present Almunecar, but it is imcertain. D'An- |

Julium ; Selambina^ ; Abdera- ; and Murci^, which is at the 
boundary of BcTtica. M. Agrippa supposed that all this 
coast was peopled by colonists of Punic origin. Beyond the 
Anas, and facing the Atlantic, is the country of the Bastuli'* 
and the Turditani. M. Varro informs us, that the Iberians, 
the Persians, the Phoenicians, the Celts, and the Carthagi- 
nians spread themselves over the whole of Spain ; that the 
name " Lusitania" is derived from the games (lusus) of 
Father Bacchus, or the fury (lyssa^) of his frantic attendants, 
and that Pan® was the governor of the whole of it. But the 
traditions respecting Hercules^ and Pyrene, as well as Satimi, 
I conceive to be fabulous in the highest degree. 

The Bsetis does not rise, as some writers have asserted, 
near the to\\Ti of Mentisa^, in the province of Tarraco, but 
in the Tugiensian Eorest^ ; and near it rises the river Tader^", 
which waters the territory of Carthage". At Ilorcum^- it 

ville says the present Torre de Banas ; others have suggested the town 
of Motril. 

^ Now Salobrena. 

2 Either the present Adra or Abdera : it is uncertain which. 

3 Probably the present Mujacar. D'Anville suggests Ahneria. 

^ Also called Bastitani, a mixed race, partly Iberian and partly Phoe- 
nician. 

5 The Greek Ay (To-a, "frantic rage" or "madness." The etymologies 
here suggested are puerUe in the extreme. 

6 Plutarch, quoting from the Twelfth Book of the Tberica of Sosthenes, 
tells us that, " After Bacchus had conquered Iberia [the present Spain], 
he left Pan to act as his deputy, and he changed its name and called the 
country Pania^ after himself, which afterwards became corrupted into 
Spania." 

^ He aUudes to the expedition of Hercules into Spain, of which Dio- 
dorus Siculus makes mention ; also his com'tship of the nymph Pyrene, 
the daughter of Bebryx, who was buried by him on the Pyrenajan 
mountains, which thence derived their name. 

'^ It is unknowTi where this town was situate ; Hardouin and D'An- 
viUe think it was on the site of the present village of San Thome, once 
an episcopal see, now removed to Jaen. The people of Mentisa, men- 
tioned in c. 4, were probably inhabitants of a ditferont place. D Anville 
in his map has two Mcntisas, one ' Oretana,' the other ' Bastitana. 

9 According to D'Anville, the place now called Toia. 

W Now the Segura. 

^^ 'Nova' or 'New' Carthage, so called fi*om liaving b(x&gt;n originally 
foimded by a colony of Carthaginians B.C. 242. It was situate a Httlo to 
the west of the Satumi Promontorium, or Promontory of Palos. It 
was taken by Scipio Africanus the elder B.C. 210.

turns away from the Funeral Pile^ of Scipio ; then taking a 
sweep to the left, it falls into the Atlantic Ocean, giving its 
name to this province: at its source it is but small, though 
during its course it receives many other streams, which it de- 
prives as well of their waters as their renown. It first enters 
Bastica in Ossigita-nia'^, and glides gently, with a smooth 
current, past many towns situate on either side of its banks. 
Between this river and the sea-shore the most celebrated 
places inland are Segida^, also surnamed Augurina ; Julia^, 
called Fidentia; Urgao^ or Alba, Ebora^ or Cerealis, Ili- 
berri'' or Liberini, Ilipula^ or Laus, Artigi^ or Julienses, 
Vesci^*^ or Faventia, Singili", Attegua^'^, Arialdunum, Agla 
Minor", Baebro^^, Castra Yinaria^^, Cisimbrium^*', Hippo 

^ This place is even now called by the inliabitants Sepulcro de Scipion. 
Cneius Cornelius Scipio Calvus, aftei' tlie defeat of his brother P. Cor- 
nehus Scipio, in the year B.C. 211, by the forces of Asdrubal and Mago, 
fled to a tower at this spot, which was set fire to by the troops of Asdrubal, 
and he perished in the flames. 

2 So called from the town of Ossigi afterwards mentioned. 

3 It is unknown where this place stood ; Medina Sidonia has been 
suggested. 

■* Probably the present Fuentes del Eey, between Andujar and Jaen, 
according to Pinet. 

^ D'Anville suggests that this is the present Arjona ; but more pro- 
bably it was the village of Arjonilla, two leagues south of Andujar. 
Gruterhas an inscription found here, "mukic . albense ue&amp;anon." 

^ There were five cities of this name in Spam. Hardouin tliinks that 
this is the modem Alcala la Real, between Granada and Cordova. 

^ Most pi'obably the modern Sierra de Elvu*a, though some writers 
have suggested the city of Granada. 

8 Probably near the modern Montilla. Hardouin takes it to be the 
present Granada. 

^ Poinsinet thinks that this is the present Ecija, but other writers take 
it to be Alhama, between Granada and Malaga. 

^0 Perhaps the present Archidona. Some writers have suggested the 
modem Faventia and Velez. 

" Probably near the present Puente de Don Gonzalo, on the banks of 
the Rio Genii. 

^2 Probably near Agiular on the river Cabra ; or else the present Teba, 
between Osima and Antequera. ^^ Agla the Less. 

^* Probably the present Cabra. The sites of the two preceding towns 
are not known. 

15 « rpjjQ Encampment in the Yineyards." Probably this was the same i 
as the Castra Postumiana mentioned by Hirtius in his Book on the Spa- 
nish War as being four miles from Attegua. It appears to be the pre- 
sent Castro, or Castro el Rio, situate on the banks of the river Guadajoz.

also surnamed Laconicum, Iliturgi^ or Forum Julium, Ipas- 
turgi^" or Triumphale, Setia, and, fourteen niiles inland, 
Obulco", which is also called Pontificense. 

Next to these comes Epora^', a federate town, Sacih'^ 
Martialium, and Onoba^^. On the right bank is Corduba, 
a Eoman colony, surnamed Patricia ^^ ; here the Baetis first 
becomes navigable. There are also the towns of Carbula 

^ Its present site is unknown. 

2 According toD'Anville, the present Puente de Pinos, six leagues north 
of Grranada. Others take it to be Illora, south of Alcala la Real. 

3 The present Huesca, according to Hardouin ; more probably, how- 
ever, Huector, on the banks of the river Grenil. 

■* Perhaps Escusar, five leagues from Granada. But according to some 
it is the same as Truelo or Eruelo. 

5 Called Ucubis by Hh'tius. Morales suggests that it is Sierra la 
Eonda, but Piaet says Stoponda. 

^ The sites of this and the preceding place are unknown. 

'^ In relation to the ' conventus juridicus,' we may here observe that 
under the Roman sway, in order to facihtatc the administration of jus- 
tice, a proviuce was divided into a number of districts or ch'cuits, each of 
which was so called, as also ' forum ' or ' jm'isdictio.' At certain times of 
the year fixed by the proconsid or chief magistrate, the people assembled 
in the chief town of the district (whence the name ' conventus '), upon 
which judges were selected to try the causes of htigant parties. 

3 Probably near the town at the present day called Espelui. Strabo, 
in Book iii., teUs us that Laconian institutions and customs were prevalent 
in some parts of Spain. 

^ This place was ravaged by fire and levelled with the ground by the 
troops of Scipio, ia consequence of the vigorous defence they had made, 
and the losses they had caused to the Roman army. It probably stood 
about foiu* miles from the present city of Baeza. 

^0 The sites of tliis place and the next are unknown. 

^^ Most probably the present town of Porcuna. Ubeda or Ubedos 
haa also been suggested.

^^ Ansart suggests that the reading is not Sacih of the IMartiales, 
but Ouoba of the Martiales, to distinguish it from Onoba ^Estuaria, 
previously mentioned. It is not improbable tlmt the place was so called 
from the Martian or Martial legion having originally colonized it. The 
site of Onoba is miknown.

among the original colonists, when it was founded by Marcellus. To the

and Detunda\ and the river Singulis^, which falls into the 
Bsetis on the same side. 

The towns in the jurisdiction of Hispalis are the following : 
Celti, Arua^, Canama'*, Evia, Ilipa^, surnamed Ilia, and Ita- 
lica*^. On the left of the river is the colony of Hispahs'' named 
E-omnliensis, and, on the opposite side^, the town of Osset^, 
surnamed Julia Constantia, Yergentum, or Juli Grenius^'^, 
Orippo, Caura^\ Siarum, and the river Menoba^^, which 
enters the Bsetis on its right bank. Between the sestuaries 
of the Bsetis lie the towns of Nebrissa^^, surnamed Yeneria, 
and of Colobona^^. The colonies are, Asta^^, which is also 
called Regia, and, more inland, that of Aside ^^, surnamed 
Csesariana. 

The river Singulis, discharging itself into the Bsetis at the 
place already mentioned, washes the colony of Astigi^^, sur- 

present day it is noted for the pride of its nobles. The Great Captain 
Gronzalo de Cordova used to say, that " other towns might be better to 
live in, but there was none better to be born in." It was the birth-place 
of Lucan and the two Senecas. 

^ The site of these two places is unknown at the present day. 

2 Now called by the similar name of Genii or Xenil. 

3 Perhaps the present Alcolea. 

* Perhaps the Cantillana of the present day : there is, however, the 
greatest imcertainty as to the sites of these places. 

^ According to Hardouin, the modern city of Penaflor : D'AnviHe 
places it about two leagues thence, and near the city of Lora. 

^ Now Sevilla la Vieja, or Old Seville ; called by the lower classes 
Santi-pone. 

7 Now Seville. This colony was founded by Jidius Csesar, and also 
bore the name of Juha Romula. * Or north side of the river. 

^ Probably on the site of the present Aleala del Rio. 

^^ ' The [good] genius of Juhus,' probably meaning Csesar. Nothing 
seems to be known of its site. 

1^ Caura may be the present Coi'ia, a town three leagues from Seville, 

^2 Probably the Eio Guadalete. 

^2 Either the present Sebrija, or in the vicuiity of the city of San 
Lucar. ^^ Probably the present Bonania. 

^^ Probably between Trebujena and the city of Xeres. It was the 
usual place of meeting for the people of the territory of Gades ; and its 
unportance may be judged from its appellation ' Regia ' or ' royal,' and its 
numerous coins. Its ruins are still to be seen on a hill there. 

^^ It is not improbable that this was the pi^esent city of Xeres. Some 
geographers however take it to be that of Medina Sidonia, and look 
upon Xeres as the site of the ancient Asta.

of the river, on its tributary the Singuhs or Xenil.

Virtus Julia-, Attubi or Claritas Juha^jUrso"* or GenuaUrba- 
norum ; and among them in former times Munda^, which was 
taken with the son of Pompey. The free towns are Old As- 
tigi^ and Ostippo^ ; the tributary towns are Callet, Callecula, 
Castra Gemina, the Lesser Ilipula, Merucra, Sacrana, Obul- 
cula^, and Oningis. As you move away from the sea-coast, 
near where the river Menoba is navigable, you find, at no 
great distance, the Alontigiceli and the Alostigi^. 

The country which extends from the Bsetis to the river 
Anas, beyond the districts already described, is called Bfe- 
turia, and is divided into two parts and the same number of 
nations ; the Celtici^", who border upon Lusitania, in the ju- 

1 The site of this place is unknown. It probably obtained its name 
from being a colony of one of the legions, the 7th, 10th, 13th or 14th ; 
which were caUed ' gemmae ' or ' gemellse,' from being composed of the 
men of two legions originally. 

2 " The Yalom* of Juhus." Sanson places it not far from Miragcnil. 

3 '• The Fame of Juhus." Perhaps the present OUvera, or else Teba, 
six leagues to the south of Estepa. 

^ The present city of Ossuna. " Genua ITrbanorum " would seem to 
mean " the knees of the citizens." Though all the MSS. agree in this read- 
ing, it probably is an en-or for " gemina Urbanorum," and it may liave been 
a colony of one of the legions called ' geminse ' or ' gemelke,' as previously 
mentioned. The other part of its appellation may possibly have originated 
in the fact of its first inhabitants being all natives of the city of Rome. 

° The use of the word /m/^, 'was,' impUes that the place had been 
destroyed. Cneius Pompeius, the eldest son of Pompey the Great, was 
defeated at Munda, in the year B.C. 45, and the town destroyed. Pom- 
pey escaped from the battle, but was taken a short time after and 
put to death. The site of the ancient town is very generally supposed 
to be the modern village of Monda, S.W. of Malaga, and about thi-ee 
leagues from the sea. It is more probable however that it was in the 
vicinity of Cordova, and tliere are ruins of ancient walls and towers be- 
tween Martos, Alcandete, Espejo and Baena, wliich are supposed to denote 
its site. 

^'Now Alameda ; eight leagues from the other Astiji or Ecija. 

7 Now Estepa, six leagues from Ecija. 

8 Perhaps Mancloua, between the towns of Ecija and Carmona ; the 
sites of all the other places here mentioned appear to be quite unknown. 

^ Sanson supposes the Alostigi to have inliabitcd the territory near 
Ahnagia, between Malaga and Antiqueira.

risdiction of Hispalis, and the Turdiili, v,ho dwell on the 
verge' of Lusitania and Tarraconensis, and are under the 
protection of the laws of Corduba. It is evident that the 
Celtici have sprung from the Celtiberi, and have come from 
Lusitania, from their religious rites, their language, and the 
names of their towns, which in Bsetica are distinguished by 
the folloA&lt;-ing epithets^, which have been given to them. 
Seria has received the surname of Eama Julia^ Ner- 
tobrii^a that of Concordia Julia^ Segida that of Eestituta 
Julia^, and Contributa^ that of Julia. What is now Cui-iga 
was formerly Ucultuniacum, Constantia Julia^ was Laconi- 
murgis, the present Fortunales were the Tereses^ and the 
Emanici were the Callenses^ Besides these, there are in 
Celtica the to^^Tis of Acinippo'", Arunda'\ Aruci^', Turo- 
briga, Lastigi, Salpesa, Ssepone, and Serippo. 

The other Bseturia, which we have mentioned, is inhabited 
by the Turduli, and, in the jurisdiction of Corduba, has some 
towns which are by no* means inconsiderable; Arsa'^, 

Guadiana and Guadalquivir, the eastern parts of Alentejo and the west 
of Estremadura, as far as the city of Badajoz. 

1 Probably part of Estremadura, and the vicinity of Badajoz in an 
easterly direction. 

2 The exact meaning of this passage is somevrhat obscm'e, but he pro- 
bably means to say that the Celtici have an identity of sacred rites, lan- 
guage, and names of towns with the Celtiberians ; though it had become 
the usage in Baetica more generally to distinguish the towns by theh^ 
Roman names. 

3 " The Fame of Julius." Its site is not known. 

4 " The Concord of Juhus." Probably the same as the modem Yalera 
la Vega, near Frejenal. 

5 Probably meaning "Restored by Julius." Notliing is known of its site. 

6 According to an authority quoted by Hardouia, this may possibly be 
Medina de las Torres. 

7 Probably Constantina in Andalusia, to the north of Penaflor. 

8 The tribe or nation of the Tereses are supposed to have dwelt in the 
vicinity of the modern San Nicolo del Puerto. 

3 Calentum was their town ; probably the present Cazalla near Alaniz. 
This place will be found mentioned by Pluiy in B. xxxv. c. 14. 

10 The ruins two leagues north of Ronda la Vieja are supposed to be 
those of tliis place. There are the remains of an aqueduct and theatre, 
and numerous coins are found here. 

" Probably the present Ronda la Vieja. 

1- Identified by inscriptions with the present Aroche. The sites of 
several of the following places are unknown. 

13 The Azuaga of modern times ; but, according to Hardouin, Argallen.

Mellaria^ Mirobriga^, and Sisapo', in tlie district of 
Osintias. 

To the jurisdiction of Gades belongs Eegina, witb Eoman 
citizens ; and L?epia, IJlia'*, Carisa' surnamed Aurelia, Urgia^ 
or Castrum Julium, likewise called C?esaris Salutarieusis, 
all of which enjoy the Latian rights. The tributary towns 
are Besaro, Belippo'', Barbesula, Lacippo, Baesippo, Callet, 
Cappacum, Oleastro, Ituci, Brana, Lacibi, Saguntia^, and 
AudorissD. 

M. Agrippa has also stated tlie whole length of this pro- 
vince to be 475 miles ^, and its breadth 257 ; but this was at 
a time when its boundaries extended to Carthage^", a circum- 
stance which has often caused great errors in calculations ; 
which are generally the result either of changes eftected in the 
limits of pro\'inces, or of the fact that in the reckoning of dis- 
tances the length of the miles has been arbitrarily increased or 
diminished. In some parts too the sea has been long making 
encroachments upon the land, and in others again the shores 
have advanced ; while the course of rivers in this place has 
become more serpentine, in that more direct. And then, 
besides, some writers begin their measurements at one place, 

^ According to Hardoviin this was on the site of the modem Fuente 
de la Ovejuna, fovirteen leagues from Cordova. 

2 This has been identified by inscriptions with the modern Yilla de 
Capilla. 

3 According to Hardouin, the modem Almaden de la Plata. 
'* Probably the same as the modem Monte Major. 

^ The ruins of this place are probably those seen at Carixa, near 
Bornos, in the vicinity of Seville. 

^ Accovchng to Hardouin, the same as the modem Las Cabezas, not 
far from Lebrija. 

7 The sites of these two towns are unknown. Baesippo, Barbesula and 
Callet have been already mentioned. 

^ The ruins of Saguntia are to be seen between Arcos and Xeres della 
Frontera, on the river Guadalete ; they bear their ancient name under 
the form of Cigonza. Mela, B. iii. c. 1, says that Oleastro was a grove 
near the Bay of Cadiz. Brana was probably the same place that is men- 
tioned by Ptolemy under the name of Urbona. 

^ We may here mention for the more correct information of the reader 
that the Roman mile consisted of 1000 paces, each pace being five Enghsh 
feet. Hence its length was 1618 English yards (taking the Roman 
foot at 11"G1'96 English inches), or 143 yards less than the Enghsh 
statute mile. 

^^ Nova Cartliago, or New Carthage.

and some at another, and so proceed in different directions ; 
and hence the result is, that no two accounts agree. 

(2.) At the present day the length of Bsetica, from the 
town of Castulo\ on its frontier, to Grades is 250 miles, and 
from Murci, which lies on the sea-coast, twenty-five miles 
more. The breadth, measured from the coast of Carteia, is 
234 miles. Who is there that can entertain the belief that 
Agrippa, a man of such extraordinary diligence, and one who 
bestowed so much care on his subject, when he proposed to 
place before the eyes of the world a survey of that world, could 
be guilty of such a mistake as this, and that too when seconded 
by the late emperor the divine Augustus ? Por it was that 
emperor who completed the Portico^ which had been begun 
by his sister, and in which the survey was to be kept, in con- 
formity with the plan and descriptions of M. Agrippa. 

CHAP. 4. (3.) — OP NEARER SPAIN. 

Tlie ancient form of the Nearer Spain, like that of many 
other provinces, is somewhat changed, since the time when 
Pompey the Grreat, upon the trophies which he erected in 
the Pyrenees, testified that 877 towns, from the Alps to the 
borders of the Parther Spain, had been reduced to subjection 
by him. The whole province is now divided into seven juris- 
dictions, those of Carthage^, of Tarraco, of Caesar Augusta'*, of 

* Now Cazlona, on the confines of New Castile and the kingdom of 
Granada. It was a place of great importance, and the chief town of the 
Oretani. Himiloe, the rich wife of Hannibal, was a native of this place. 

2 This was the ' porticus Octavise,' which, havmg been commenced by 
his sister Octavia, the wife of MarceUus and Antony, was completed by 
Augustus. It lay between the Circus Flaminius and the Theatre of Mar- 
ceUus, occupying the site of the former portico, which had been built by 
Q. Csecihus Metehus, and enclosing the two temples of Juno and of Ju- 
piter Stator. It contained a pubhc hbrary, in which the Senate often 
met, and it was in this probably that the map or plan, mentioned by 
PUny, was deposited. It also contained a great nrmiber of statues, 
paintings, and other works of art, which, with the hbrary, were destroyed 
by fire in the reign of Titus. 

' Nova Carthago or New Carthage, now Carthagena. 

* Now Zaragoza or Saragossa, on the right bank of the river Ebro. Its 
original name was Salduba, but it was changed in honour of Augustus, 
who colonized it after the Cantabrian war, B.C. 25. 



Chap. 4.] ACCOUNT OF COIINTEIES, ETC. 165 

Clunia\ of Asturica-, of Lucus^, and of the Bracari^. To these 
are to be added the islands, which will be described on 
another occasion, as also 293 states which are dependent on 
others ; besides which the province contains 179 towns. Of 
these, twelve are colonies, thirteen, towns with the rights of 
Boman citizens, eighteen Avith the old Latian rights, one 
confederate, and 135 tributary. 

The first people that we come to on the coast are the 
Bastuli ; after whom, proceeding according to the order which 
I shall follow, as we go inland, there are the Mentesani, the 
Oretani, and the Carpetani on the Tagus, and next to 
tbem the Yaccsei, the Vectones, and the Celtiberian Arevaci. 
The towns nearest to the coast are Urci, and Barea^ included 
in Baetica, the district of Mavitania, next to it Deitania, and 
then Contestania, and the colony of Carthago Nova ; from 
the Promontory of which, known as the Promontorium Sa- 
turni^, to the city of Caesarea^ in Mauritania, the passage is 
a distance of 187 miles. The remaining objects worthy of 
mention on the coast are the river Tader^, and the free colony 
of Ilici^, whence the Ilicitanian Grulf ° derives its name ; to 
this colony the Icositani are subordinate. 

We next have Lucentum^\ holding Latian rights; Dianium^', 
a tributary town; the river Sucre ^^, and in former times a 
town of the same name, forming the frontier of Contestania. 

1 This was the most remote place of any consideration in Celtiberia, on 
the west. Its ruins are still to be seen on the summit of a hill surrounded 
with rocks, forming a natm'al wall between Corunna del Conde and Pen- 
nalda de Castro. 

2 This was Asturica Augusta, the chief city of the nation of the Astures, 
and situate on one of the tributaries of the Astura, now Esta. On its 
site is situate the present Astorga : its ruins are very extensive. 

3 Now Lugo. 

* Or Bracara Augusta, now Braga. Among the ruins of the ancient 
city there are the remains of an aqueduct and ampliitheatre. 

5 Probably the present town of Vera near Muxacra. 

6 The " Promontory of Saturn," now Oabo de Palos, 

7 D' Anvillc takes tliis place to be the port of Vacur ; if so, the distance 
from Cape Palos is exactly 170 miles. * Now Sogura. 

* The modem town of Elche was probably built from the ruins of 
this place. ^° Now called the Gulf of Ahcant. 

" With the Arabian El prefixed, this has formed the name of the 
famous port of Ahcant. 

^ Now Denia, a thriving town. ^3 Now called the Xucar. 



166 PLiinr's katueal histoet. [Book IIL 

Next is the district of Edetania, with the delightful expanse 
of a lake^ before it, and extending backward to Celtiberia. 
Yalentia^, a colony, is situate three miles from the sea, after 
which comes the river Turium^, and Saguntum^ at the same 
distance, a town of Eoman citizens famous for its fidelity, 
the river Uduba'^ and the district of the Ilergaones^ The 
Iberus^, a river enriched by its commerce, takes its rise in 
the country of the Cantabri, not far from the town of Julio- 
briga^, and flows a distance of 450 miles ; 260 of which, from 
the to^Ti of Varia^ namely, it is available for the purposes of 
navigation. Prom this river the name of Iberia has been 
given by the Greeks to the whole of Spain. 

Next comes the district of Cossetania, the river Subi^°, 
and the colony of Tarraco, whicli was built by the Scipios as 
Carthage" was by the Carthaginians. Then the district of the 
Ilergetes, the town of Subur^'-, and the river Eubricatum^^, 
beyond which begin the Laletani and the Indigetes^"^. Be- 
hind these, in the order in w^hich they will be mentioned, 

^ Now called Albufera. 2 "jhe present city of Yalencia. 

^ Or Turia, now the Guadalaviar. 

^ Or Saguntus, famed for the fidelity of its inhabitants to the Roman 
cause : after a siege of nine months, rather than submit to the Carthaginians 
under Hannibal, they set fire to their town and perished ui the flames, B.C. 
219. It was rebuilt eight years afterwards and made a Roman colony. The 
ruins of the ancient town, which was said to have been originally founded 
by Greeks from Zacynthus, are still to be seen, and the ancient walls (^muri 
veteres) give name to the present Murviedi'o, wliich is bmlt on its site. 

^ Now the Murviedro, which flows past the city of that name and the 
town of Segorbe. 

^ Dertosa, the present Tortosa, is supposed to have been inhabited by 
them. 7 Now the Ebro. 

* Hardouin places tliis on the site of the modern Fuente de Ivero. 
The Ebro takes its rise in the Val de Yieso. 

8 According to D' Anville, the present Logrono. At present the Ebro 
only becomes navigable at Tudela, 216 miles from the sea. Other writers, 
however, take Varia to be the present Yaltierra, near Tudela. 

^^ Or the Subur, now the Francoli. It flows into the sea at the port 
of Tarraco, now Tarragona. 

^^ The more ancient commentators tliink that Carthago Yetus, or the 
colony of Old Carthage (now Carta la Yieja), is here alluded to, but more 
probably it is Carthago Nova that is meant. 

^ On the Subi, previously mentioned ; now called YiUa Nova. 

^3 Now the Llobregat.

going back from tlie foot of the Pyrenees, are tlie Ausetaui\ 
theLacetani^, and along the Pyrenees, the Cerretani^, next to 
whom are the Yascones^. On the coast is the colony of 
Barcino'\ surnamedFaventia; Baetulo^ and Iluro', towns with 
Pomau citizens; the river Larnum^, Blanda?^, the river Alba'"; 
Emporiie^', a city consisting of two parts, one peopled by the 
original inhabitants, the other by the Grreek descendants 
of the Pliocaeans ; and the river Ticher'^. From this to the 
Venus PjTen^a'^, on the other side of the Promontory, is a 
distance of forty miles. 

I shall now proceed to give an account of the more re- 
markable things in these several jurisdictions, in addition to 
those which have been already mentioned. Forty-three 
different peoples are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of 
Tarraco : of these the most famous are — holding the rights 
of Roman citizens, the Dertusani^'* and the Bisgargfitani ; 
enjoying Latian rights, the Ausetani, and the Cerretani, both 
Julian and Augustan, the Edetani'^, the Grerundenses'^, the 

1 Their chief cities were Gerunda, the present Gerona, and Ansa or 
Ticus Ausse, now Tic d'Osona. ^ i^ ^]^q country beyond Gerona. 

3 Living in the upper valley of the river Sicoris or Segre, wliich still 
retains, from them, the name of Cerdague. 

* The people of the modem Navarre and Guipuzcoa. 

* In the later writers Barcelo, now Barcelona. It was said to have 
been originally founded by Hercules, and afterwards rebuilt by Hamilcar 
Barcas, who gave it the name of liis family. Its name as a Roman colony 
was Colonia Faventia Juha Augusta Pia Barcino. The modern city 
stands somewhat to the east of the ancient one. 

^ The modem Badalona, two leagues from Barcelona. 

7 On the sea- shore, — the present Pineda. ^ Now the Tordera. 

9 The modem city of Blanos stands on its site. 

^^ Probably the pi'csent Ter or Tet. 

^^ The modem Ampurias. We learn from Strabo that a wall divided 
the to\Mi of the Greeks from that of the old inhabitants. It was the 
usual landing-place for travellers from Gaul. It was originally colonized 
by the Phocaans from Massiha or Marseilles. 

^2 Hardouin says that the Ticher or Tichis is the same with the modern 
Ter, but in such case Phny would have mentioned it before coming to Em- 
porise. Its present name however does not appear to be accurately known, 

^3 A promontoi*j' extending from the Pyrcna&gt;an chain, on which a 
temple of Venus was situate. It is now called Cabo de Cruz. The 
distance mentioned by Pliny is probably too great. 

^* The people of the present Tortosa. 

'^ Probably not the same people as the Edetani, in whose district Sa- 
guntum and Valencia were situate. ^^ The people of Gerunda or Gerona. 



168 Pliny's natueal history. [Book III. 

G-essorienses^ and tlie Teari^, also called Julienses. Among 
the tributaries are the Aquicaldenses^, the Onenses, and the 
Baeculonenses*. 

Caesar Augusta, a free colony, watered by the river Iberus, 
on the site of the town formerly called Salduba, is situate in 
the district of Edetania, and is the resort of fifty-five nations. 
Of these there are, with the rights of Eoman citizens, the 
Bellitani*, the Celsenses®, a former colony, the Calagurritani'', 
surnamed the Nassici, the Ilerdenses^, of the nation of the 
Surdaones, near whom is the river Sicoris, the Oscenses^ in 
the district of Vescitania, and the Turiasonenses^*'. Of those 
enjoying the rights of the ancient Latins, there are the 
Cascantenses",theErgavicenses^^, the Grraccuritani^^,theLeo- 

^ They are nowhere else mentioned. Ukert supposes that their city 
stood in the district between the Sicoris and Nucaria. 

2 Their city was Tiara Juha. 

3 The people of Aquae CaUdse or the ' Hot Springs,' called at the pre- 
sent day Caldes, four leagues from the city of Barcelona. 

'* Ptolemy places Bsecula between Ausa and G-erunda. 

* The people of the present Belchite. 

^ The people of the present Xelsa, on the Ebro. 

7 The inhabitants of Calagurris, now Calahorra, a city of the Vascones, 
on the banks of the Ebro. They remained faitliful to Sertorius to the last, 
and after slaughtering their wives and cluldren and eating their flesh, their 
city was taken and destroyed ; which event put an end to the Sertorian 
war. It was called " Nassica," in contradistinction to Calagurris Fibularia, 
which is afterwards mentioned by Pliny. The latter is mentioned by 
Caesar as forming one community with Osca (now Huesca), and was pro- 
bably the present Loarre, though some writers take the first-named Cala- 
gurris to be that place, and the latter one to be the present Calahorra. 

^ The people of Ilerda, the present Lerida, on the Sicoris or Segre. It 
is memorable for its siege by Caesar, when the Pompeian forces under 
Afranius and Petreius had retired thither. It was a most flourisliing city, 
though in the times of the later Roman emperors it had fallen into decay. 

^ The people of the present Huesca. 

^° The inhabitants of Turiazo, the present Tarazona, five leagues south 
of Tudela. 

^^ The people of Cascantum, the present town of Cascante in Navarre. 

^2 The people of Ergavica. Its ruins, at the confluence of the Guadiela 
and Tagus, are stUl to be seen, and are called Santaver. By some writers 
this place is considered to be the same as the modern Fraga, on the river 
Cinca, five leagues from Lerida. 

'^ The people of G-raccuris. Its former name of Ilurcis was changed 
in honour of Sempronius Gracchus, who placed new settlers there after 
the conquest of Celtiberia. It is supposed to be the same as the modem, 
Agreda, four leagues from Tarazona.

iiicenses\ and the Osicerdenses ; of federate states, there 
are the Tarragenses" ; and of tributaries, the Arcobri- 
genses^, the Andologenses^, the Araeelitani^, the Bursao-

Fibularenses, the Complutenses^, the Carenses^, the Cin- 
censes^", the Cortonenses, the Damamtani'\ the Lar- 
nenses^^, the Lursenses^^, the Lumberitani^^, the Lacetani, 
the Lubienses, the Pompelonenses^^, and the Segienses. 

1 The people of Leonica, probably the modem Alcaniz, on the river 
Guadalope, in Arragon. 

- The people of Tarraga, tne present Tarrega, nine leagues east of 
Lerida, in Catalonia. 

3 The people of Arcobriga, now Los Ai'cos, in Navarre, five leagues 
south of EsteUa. 

■* Perhaps the same as the Andosini, a people mentioned by Polybius, 
B. iii. e. 35, as situate between the Iberus and the Pyrenees. There is a 
small town of Navarre called AndroiUa. 

5 The people probably of the site now occupied by Huarte Araquil, 
six leagues to the west of Pampeluna. 

* Probably the same as the Bursaones of Livy, the Bursavolenses of 
Hirtius, and the Bursadenses of Ptolemy. Their exact locahty is unknown. 

7 Mention has been made of Calagun'is Fibularensis or Fibuhcensis 
under Calagiirris Nassica : see p. 168. 

^ The people of Complutum, the modem Alcala de Hen ares, on the 
river Henares, six leagues to the east of Madiid. It is not quite certain 
whether it stood on the exact site of Alcala, or on the liill of Zulema, on 
the other side of the Henares. 

^•The towm of Cares, adjoining the more modem one of Puente la 
Beyna, probably marks their site. 

'" Probably so called from the river Cinga^ the modem Cinca : or they 
may have given their name thereto. 

^^ The people probably of the present Mediana on the Ebro, six 
leagues below Zaragoza. 

^ Their town was Larnum, situate on a river of the same name. It 
was probably the present Torderas, situate on the river of that name. 

^3 Of tliis people nothing appears to be known. In the old editions the 
next people mentioned are the " Ispalenses," but since the time of Har- 
douin, they have been generally omitted, as wrongly introduced, and as ut- 
terly unknown. Spanish coins have however been more recently discovered 
with the name 'Sblaie' or 'Splaie,' inscribed in Celt-iberian characters, 
and immismatists are of opinion that they indicate the name of the town 
of this pcojile, which in Latin would be Ispala. This at all events is the 
opinion of M. de Saiilcy. 

'"* The people of the present town of Lumbier in Navarre, called by its 
inhabitants Irumberri. 

'^ The people of the present city of Pampelima. 



170 pliitt's natural histoey. [Book III. 

Sixty-five different nations resort to Carthage \ besides 
the inhabitants of the islands. Of the Accitanian' colony, 
there are the G-emellenses, and the town of Libisosona^, sur- 
named Foroaugustana, to both of which have been granted 
Italian'' rights. Of the colony of Salaria^, there are the people 
of the following towns, enjoying the rights of ancient La- 
tium: the Castulonenses, also called the Cassari Venales, the 
Saetabitani*^ or Augustani, and the Valerienses''. The best 
known among the tributaries are the Alabanenses^, the Bas- 
titani^, theConsaburrenses^",the Dianenses", theEgelestani^^, 

* Carthago Nova, or New Carthage. 

2 The colony of Acci was called Colonia Julia Gemella Accitana. The 
town of Acci or Accis was on the site of the present Guadix el Yiejo, 
between Granada and Baza, It was colonized by the third and sixth 
legions under Juhus or Augustus, from wliich it obtained the name 
of ' GemeUa,' the origin of which name is previously mentioned, p. 161. 

^ The ruuis of this place are supposed to be those seen at Lebazuza or 
Lezuza, not far from the city of Cuen9a. 

^ The "jus Itahcum" or "Itahse," "ItaUan rights" or "privileges," 
differed from the " jvis Latinum." It was granted to provincial towns 
which were especially favoured by the magistracy of Rome, and consisted 
of exemption from taxes, a municipal constitution, after the manner of 
the Itahan tovms, and many other rights and exemptions. 

^ According to Hardouin, the people of the town formerly called Sa- 
liotis, now Cazorla. They are called " Caesari venales," from the cfrcum- 
stance of their territory having been purchased by Caesar. — Castulo or 
Cazlona has been previously mentioned. 

^ The people of Saetabis, now Xativa in Yalencia. Tliis town was fa- 
mous for its manufacture of fine table-napkins, to wliich reference is made 
by Phny at the beginning of his Introduction addressed to Titus, ia liis 
quotation from the lament of Catullus on the loss of his table-napkins 
which his friends had filched from him. See p. 1 of the present volume. 

7 According to some vsriters, the present Cuen^a was the ancient Va- 
leria ; but perhaps it was situate at the present village of Valera la Yieja, 
or Old Yaleria, eight leagues south of Cuenga. 

* The people of Alaba, not far from the present town of Ergavica. 

^ They were so called from their town of Basti, now Baza, on the river 
Guadalentin in Granada. 

^^ Their town was probably the present Consuegra, twelve leagues from 
the city of Toledo. 

" So called from the promontory Dianium or Artemisium, named from

other places, as also Segovia^ and Nova Augusta, Termes^, 
and Clunia itself, the frontier of Celtiberia. The remaining 
portion turns off towards the ocean, being occupied by the 
Yarduli, already mentioned, and the Cantabri. 

Next upon these touch the twenty-two nations of the 
Astures, who are divided into the Augustani^ and the Trans- 
montani, with the magnificent city of Asturica. Among 
these we have the Cigurri^ the Psesici, the Lancienses^", and 
the Zoelae". The total number of the free population amounts 
to 240,000 persons. 

The jurisdiction of Lucus^^ embraces, besides the Celtici 
and the Lebuni, sixteen different nations, but little known

the eminence of EetortUlo, south of Reynosa. Five stones still mark 
the boundaries wliich divided the territory from that of the Fourth Legio. 

2 Supposed to be the present Briviesca; the site of Tritiimi does not 
appear to be known, but it has been suggested that it was near Najara, 
in the vicinity of Logrono. 

3 It does not appear to be certain whether the Areva was the present 
Ucero, or the Arlanzon, which flows near Yalladohd. 

4 The modern Siguenza. 

5 Now El Burgo d'Osma, in the province of Soria.

bridge, the people preserving a tradition that an old town once stood 
there called Guigurra.

and with barbarous names. The number however of the free 
population amounts to nearly 166,000. 

In a similar manner the twenty -four states of the juris- 
diction of the Bracari contain a population of 175,000, among 
whom, besides the Bracari^ themselves, we may mention, 
without wearying the reader, the Bibali, the Coelerni, the 
Gallseci, the HeqWsi, the Limici, and the Querquerni. 

The length of the Nearer Spain, from the Pyrenees to the 
frontier of Castulo, is 607- miles, and a little more if we fol- 
low the line of the coast ; while its breadth, from Tarraco to 
the shore of Olarson^ is 307^ miles. From the foot of the 
PjTenees, where it is wedged in by the near approach of the 
two seas, it gradually expands until it touches the Farther 
Spain, and thereby acquires a width more than double ^ 

Nearly the whole of Spain abounds in mines ^ of lead, iron, 

1 The people of Bracara Augusta, now Braga. Among the riiias of 
the ancient city are the remains of an aqueduct and an amphitheatre. 
This people probably derived their name from then- fasliion of wearing 
braccse, " breeches" or " trowsers," like their neighbours of GaUia Brac- 
cata. The exact locahties of the various other tribes here mentioned do 
not appear to be exactly known. 

2 Our author is mistaken here, even making allowance for the short- 
ness of the Roman mile (1618 yards), as the length is only 470 miles. 
Coastwise it is 620.

* He is also in error here ; for, taken in a straight hue, tliis distance 
is but 210 miles. * The distance is about 560 miles. 

^ It may be worth while here to take some notice of the mineral pro- 
ductions of Spain in modem times, from which we shall be able to form 
a more accurate judgement as to the correctness of the statement here 
made by Phny. Grains of gold are still to be found in the rivers Tagus 
and Douro ; but there is not found sufficient of the precious metal to pay 
for the search. Silver is found m the mines of the Guadal canal. Copper 
and lead are to be foimd in abundance. There is a mine of plumbago 
four leagues from Ronda ; and tin is found in GaUicia. In every pro- 
vince there are iron mines, those in Biscay being tlie most remarkable. 
Lodestone is foimd in Seville, cobalt on the Pyrenees, quicksilver and 
cmnabar at Almaden, arsenic m Asturias, and coal in Asturias and Arra- 
gon. There are salt-mines at Mingrilla and Cardona ; almn is found in Ar- 
ragon, antimony at Alcaraz. On the Sierra Morena, and in Gallicia, there 
is saltpetre in numerous locahties ; amber in Asturias and Valencia, and 
sulphur in Murcia, Arragon, and Seville. Pipe-clay of a pecuhar quahty is 
found in the vicmity of Andujar. Gypsum and marble are found in great 
abundance, and stone for building purjwses, of the best quality. Aine- 
thysts, white cornehans, rubies, agates, garnets, and rock crystals, with 
other precious stones, are also found in abundance and of the finest quality.

are also quarries of marble. The Emperor Vespasianus

That part of the Grallias which is washed by the inland sea^ 
is called the province of [Grallia] Narbonensis^, having 
formerly borne the name of Braccata"*. It is divided from 
Italy by the river Varus ^, and by the range of the Alps, the 
great safeguards of the Roman Empire. Erom the remainder 
of Graul, on the north, it is separated by the mountains Ge- 
henna "^ and Jura*^. In the cultivation of the soil, the man- 
ners and civilization of the inhabitants, and the extent of its 
wealth, it is surpassed by none of the provinces, and, in short, 
might be more truthfully described as a part of Italy than 
as a province. On the coast we have the district of the 
Sordones^, and more inland that of the Consuarani^. The

bonne, situate on the river Atax, now Aude. It was made a Roman 
colony by the Consul Q. Martins B.C. 118, and from him received its sur- 
name. It was the residence of the Roman governor of the province and 
a place of great commercial importance. There are scarcely any remains 
of the ancient city, but some vestiges of the canal, by which it was con- 
nected with the sea at twelve miles' distance.

city, and Rnscino^, a town with Latian rights. A\^e then 
come to the river Atax^ which flows from the Pyrenees, and 
passes through the Eubrensian Lake*, the town of Narbo 
Martins, a colony of the tenth legion, twelve miles distant 
from the sea, and the rivers Arauris^ and Liria-^. The towns 
are otherwise but few in number, in consequence of the 
numerous lakes' which skirt the sea-shore. We have Aga- 
tha^ formerly belonging to the Massilians, and the district of 
the Volcae Tectosages^*^ ; and there is the spot where Ehoda", 
a Ehodian colony, formerly stood, from which the river takes 
its name of Ehodanus'- ; a stream by far the most fertilizing 
of any in either of the Gallias. Descending from the Alps 
and rushing through lake Lemanus^^, it carries along with it 
the sluirHsh Arar^"*, as well as the torrents of the Isara and 

in 

the Druentia^^ no less rapid than itself. Its two smaller 
mouths are called Libica^*^, one being the Spanish, and the 

1 Probably the Tech, and the Yerdouble, which falls into the Glj. 

2 Probably the present Ehie, on the Tech. 

3 The present Castel Eoussillon, •* The Aude of the present day. 
^ The bodies of water now called Etangs de Bages et de Sigean. 

^ Now the Herault. 

7 Now called the Lez, near the city of MontpeUier. 

** Now called Etangs de Leucate, de Sigean, de Gruissan, de Tendrcs, 
de Thau, de Magnelonne, de Perols, de Mauguio, du Repausset ; Marais 
d'Escamandre, de Lemiitane et de la Souteyrane, and numerous others. 

^ Now the town of Agde. Strabo also informs us that this place was 
foimded by the MassHians. 

^^ This people seems to have inhabited the eastern parts of the depart- 
ments of r Arriege and the Haute Garonne, that of Aude, the south of 
that of Tarn, and of that of Herault, except the arrondissement of Mont- 
peUier. 

11 Dalechamp takes this to be Eoz les Martigues ; but the locaUty is 
doubtfvd. Most probably tliis is the same place that is mentioned by 
Strabo as Rhoe, in conjunction with the town of Agathe or Agde, and 
the Rodanusia of Stephen of Byzantium, who places it in the district of 
Massiha or Marseilles. 

12 Now the Rhone. i3 Now the Lake of Geneva.

there are coins in existence, but notliing else seems to be known. At 
the present day there are four mouths of the Rhone, the mo?t westerly 
of which is called the " Dead" Rhone ; the next tlie " Lesser" Rlionc ; 
the tMrd the " Old " Rhone ; and the fourth suuply the Rhone. D'Au-

other tlie Metapinian moutli ; the third and largest is called 
the Massiliotic^ There are some authors who state that there 
was formerly a town called Heraclea^ at the mouth of the 
E-hodanus or Ehone. 

Beyond this are the Canals^ leading out of the Ehone, a

name ; the Lake of Mastramela', the town of Maritima' of the 
Avatici, and, above this, the Stony Plains^ memorable for the 

viUe considers the "Lesser" Rhone to hare been the "Spanish" mouth 
of the ancients. In consequence of the overflowings of this river there is 
great confusion upon tliis subject. 

1 This mouth of the Rhone was much used by the Massihans for the 
purposes of commerce with the interior of G-aul, and the carriage of the 
supphes of tua which they obtained thence. 

2 The manner in wliich Phny here expresses himself shows that he 
doubts the fact of such a place having even existed ; it is mentioned by 
none of the preceding geographers, and of those who followed him Stephen 
of Byzantium is the only one who notices it. An inscription was found 
however in the reign of Charles V. of France, in which it was stated that 
Ataulphus, king of the Visigoths, selected Heraclea as his place of resi- 
dence. On the faith of tliis inscription, Spon and Ducange have placed 
Heraclea at the modem Saint- Grilles, and other writers at Saint-Remy, 
where the inscription was found. Unfortunately, however, Messrs. Devic 
and Vaissette, in then- "History of Languedoc," have proved that this 
inscription is of spurious origin. 

3 The "Fossae Marianse" are also mentioned by Ptolemy and Solinus ; 
though they differ in the situation which they have respectively assigned 
them. They were formed by Marius when advancing to dispute the 
passage of the Rhone with the Cunbri, who had quitted Spain for the 
purpose of passing the Pyi-enees and invading Italy, ui the year B.C. 102. 
There is considerable difficulty in determining their position, but they 
are supposed to have commenced at the place now called the Camp of 
Marius, and to have terminated at the eastern mouth of the Rhone near 
the present Aries. 

* Phny is the first who mentions the name of tliis lake, though pre- 
vious writers had indicated its existence. Strabo informs us that above 
the mouth of the Rhone there is a large lake that commimicates with the 
sea, and abounds m fish and oysters. Brotier and D'AnviUe identify it 
with the present lake of Martigues or of Berre. 

5 D'AnviUe takes this place to be the present town of Martigues ; Bro- 
tier tlimks that it was situate on the spot now called Le Cap d'CEil,near 
the town of Samt-Chamas ; and Bouche, the historian of the Province, 
places it at Marignane, on the east side of the lake aheady mentioned. ^^ 

6 "Campi Lapidei," called by the natives at the present day "LaCrau; 
probably from the same Celtic root as our word "Crags ;" though Bochart 
derives it from the Hebrew, ^schylus and Hyginus speak of this com-

inland, that of the Desuviates'-^ and tlie Cavari. Again, close 
upon the sea, there is that of the Tricorii^, and inland, there 
are the Tricolli"*, the Vocontii^ and the Segovellauni, and, 
after them, the Allobroges". 

On the coast is Massilia, a colony of Phocaean^ Greeks, 
and a federate^ city ; we then have the Promontory of Zao^, 
the port of Cithari'sta'", and the district of the Camatullici^' ; 
then the Suelteri^-, and above them the Yerrucini^^. Again, 

bat of Hercules, and Mela relates that being engaged in a mortal struggle 
with Albion and G-eryon, the sons of Keptune, he invoked the aid of 
Jupiter, on wliich a shower of stones fell from the heavens and destroyed 
his antagonists. Those on tliis plain are said to be the reniams of the 
stony shower. It is supposed by the scientific that many of these stones 
are aerohtes, and that trachtion has ingeniously adapted this stor^^ to 
tlieh real origin. The vicinity of Tunbridge Wells presents a somewhat 
similar appearance. 

1 The people probably of the site of the present isle of Camargue. 

2 They probably inhabited the district south of the Durance, between 
it and the Rhone. 

3 They mhabited the country m which the present Avignon, Orange, 
Cavaillon, and perhaps Carpentras are situate. 

■* They are thought by Hardouin to have dwelt in the vicinity of the 
present tov^-n of Talard in the department of the Ilautes Alpes. 

s They inliabited the eastern part of the departments of the Drome and 
the Yaucluse. 

^ Their territory comprehended the southern part of the department 
of the Am, the department of the Isere, the canton of Geneva, and part 
of Savoy. 

7 It was said to have been colonized from Phocfca, a town of Ionia in 
Asia Minor. Lucan in his Third Book more than once falls into the 
error of supposing that it was colonized from Phocis in Greece. 

8 We learn from Justin, B. xliii., that this privilege, as well as others, 
and a seat at the public shows, were granted to the MassHians b\ the 
Roman Ser ato, in return for their sympathy and assistance alter the city 
had been taken and plundered by the Gauls.

takes it to be the Cap de la Croisette.

" Probably occupying the south-east of the department of the Var. 

It is supposed by Ilardoiiin that the village of Ramatuelle, near the coast, 
Gouth of the Giilf of Grimaud, represents the ancient name ; and D' An- 
ville and other writers are of the same oi)inion. 

12 Probalily the country around the modem Brignole and Draguignau 
was inliabited by them.

Saussaye says that their coins read ' Samnagenses,' and not ' Sanagenses,' 
and that they inhabited Senas, a town in the vicinity of Aix.

Haute- Garonne.

whom we have Etniria, Umbria, Latiiim, Avhere the mouths of 
tlie Tiber are situate, aud Eome, the Capital of the world, 
sixteen miles distant from the sea. We then oouie to the 
coasts of the Volsci and of Campania, and the districts of 
Picenum, of Lucania, and of Bruttium, where Italy extends 
the farthest in a southerly direction, and projects into the 
[two] seas with the chain of the Alps', which tliere forms 
pretty nearly the shape of a crescent. Leading Bruttium 
we come to the coast of [Magna] Graecia, tiien the Salentini, 
the Pediculi, the Apuli, the Peligni, the Frentani, the Mar- 
rucini, the Vestini, the Sabini, the Picentes, the Galli, the 
Umbri, the Tusci, the Veneti, the Carni, the lapydes, the 
Histri, and the Liburni. 

1 am by no means unaware that I might be justly accused 
of ingratitude and indolence, were I to describe thus briefly 
and in so cursory a manner the land which is at once the 
foster-child- and the parent of all lands; chosen by the pro- 
vidence of the Gods to render even heaven itself more glori- 
ous'', to unite the scattered empires of the earth, to bestow a 
polish upon men's manners, to unite the discordant and un- 
couth dialects of so many different nations by the powerful 
ties of one common language, to confer the enjoyments of 
discourse and of civilization upon mankind, to become, in 
short, the mother-country of all nations of the Earth. 

But how shall I commence this undertaking ? So vast is 
the ninnber of celebrated places (what man living could 
eiumierate them all?), and so great the renown attached 
to each individual nation and subject, that 1 feel myself quite 

sidcration when we proceed, in c. 7, to a more minute description of 
Italy. 

^ This passage is somewhat confused, and may possibly be in a corrupt 
state. He here speaks of the Apennine Alps. By the "lunata juga" 
he means the two pi-omontorics or capes, which extend east and west 
re&lt;]iectively. 

2 This seems to be the meaning of " alumna," and not " nurse" or 
"foster-mother," as Ajaisson's translation lias it. Pliny probably m\- 
plies by this antithesis that Rome has been " twice blessed," in receiving 
the bounties of all nations of the world, tjnd in lieing able to bestow a 
connnensurate retiu'n. Compared whh tliis itiea, "at once the nui'se and 
niotlier of the world" would be tame indeed!

what Pliny has said in his Second Book, tliis looks very much hke pure 
adulation.

at a loss. The city of Eome alone, which forms a portion 
of it, a face well worthy of shoulders so beauteous, how 
large a work would it require for an appropriate description ! 
And then too the coast of Campania, taken singly by itself! 
so blest with natural beauties and opulence, that it is evident 
that when nature formed it she took a delight in accumulating 
all her blessings in a single spot — how am I to do justice to 
it ? And then the climate, with its eternal freshness and so 
replete with health and vitality, the sereneness of the weather 
so enchanting, the fields so fertile, the hill sides so sunny, 
the thickets so free from every danger, the groves so cool and 
shady, the forests with a vegetation so varying and so luxu- 
riant, the breezes descending from so many a mountain, the 
fruitfulness of its grain, its vines, and its olives so transcend- 
ent ; its flocks with fleeces so noble, its bulls with necks so 
sinewy, its lakes recurring in never-ending succession, its 
numerous rivers and springs which refresh it with their waters 
on every side, its seas so many in number, its havens and the 
bosom of its lands opening everywhere to the commerce of 
all the world, and as it were eagerly stretching fortli into 
the very midst of the waves, for the purpose of aiding as it 
were the endeavours of mortals ! 

Por the present I forbear to speak of its genius, its man- 
ners, its men, and the nations whom it has conquered by 
eloquence and force of arms. The very Greeks themselves, 
a race fond in the extreme of expatiating on their own praises, 
have amply given judgment in its favour, when they named 
but a small part of it ' Magna GrseciaV' But we must be 
content to do on this occasion as we have done in our de- 
scription of the heavens ; we must only touch upon some of 
these points, and take notice of but a few of its stars. I 
only beg my readers to bear in mind that I am thus hasten- 

^ Or "Great Greece." Tlais is a poor and frivolous argument used by 
Pliny in support of his laudations of Italy, seeing that in all probabi- 
lity it was not the people of Greece who gave this name to certain cities 
founded by Greek colonists on the Tarentine Gulf, in the south of Italy ; 
but either the ItaUan tribes, who in their simphcity admired their splen- 
dour and magnificence, or else tlie colonists themselves, who, in using 
the name, showed that they clung with fondness to the remembrance of 
their mother-country ; wliile at the same time the epithet betrayed some 
vanity and ostentation in wisliing thus to show their superiority to the 
people of their mother-country.

ing on for the purpose of giving a general description of 
everything tliat is known to exist tlironghout the wliole earth. 
I may premise by observing that this hind very much re- 
sembles in shape an oak leaf, being much longer tlian it is 
broad ; towards the top it incHnes to the left', wldle it termi- 
nates in the form of an Amazonian buckler"*', in w hich the spot 
at the central projection is the place called Cocinthos, while it 
sends forth two horns at the end of its crescent-shaped bays, 
Leucopetra on the right and Lacinium on the left. It ex- 
tends in length 1020 miles, if we measure from the foot of 
the Alps at Prsetoria Augusta, through the city of Home and 
Capua to the town of Khegium, which is situate on the 
shoulder of the Peninsula, just at the bend of the neck as it 
were. The distance would be much greater if measured to 
Lacinium, but in that case the line, being draw^n obliquely, 
would incline too much to one side. Its breadth is variable ; 
being 410 miles between the two seas, the Lower and ihe 
Upper^, and the rivers Varus andArsia"* : at about the middle, 
and in the vicinity of the city of Rome, from the spot where 
the river Aternus^ flows into the Adriatic sea, *:i tlie mouth 
of the Tiber, the distance is 136 miles, and a little less from 
Castrum-novum on the Adriatic sea to Alsium" on the Tus- 
can ; but in no place does it exceed 200 miles in breadth. 

^ The comparison of its shape to an oak leaf Bsenis rather fanciful ; 
more common-place observers have comj)ared it to a boot : by the top 
(cacumen) he seems to mean the soutliern part of Calabria about iJrun- 
disium and Tarentum ; which, to a person facing the south, would in- 
cUne to the coast of Epirus on the left hand. 

- The ' Parma' or shiold here alluded to, would be one shaped like a 
crescent, Avith the exception tliat the inner or concave side wouUl be 
formed of two crescents, the extremities of whicli join at the central jiro- 
jection. He says that Cocmthos (now Capo di Stilo) would in such 
case form the central projection, while Lacinium (now Capo deUe Colonnc) 
■would form the horn at the extreme right, and Leucopetra (now Capo 
deU' Armi) the horn on the extreme left. 

3 The Tuscan or Etrurian sea, and the Adriatic. 

■* The Varus, as already mcntionod, was in Gallia Narbonensis, while the 
Arsia, now the Arsa, is a small river of Istria, which became the boundary 
between Italy and lllyricum, when Istria was annexed by order of Au- 
gustus to the former country. It flows into the Flanaticus Sinus, now 
Golfo di Quamero, on the eastern coast of Istria, beyond the town of 
Castel Nuovo, formerly Nesactium. * Now the Pescara. 

^ Now Palo, a city on the coast of Etruria, eighteen miles from Portua 
Augusti, at the mouth of the Tiber. 



184 plikt's natueal history. [Book III. 

The circuit of the whole, from the Yarus to the Arsia, is 3059 
miles ^ 

As to its distance from the countries that surround it — 
Istria and Liburnia are, in some places', 100 miles from it, 
and E})irus and lUyricum 50 ; Africa is less than 200, as we 
are informed by M. Varro ; Sardinia^ is 120, Sicily IJ, Corsica 
less than 80, and Issa"* 50. It extends into the two seas 
towards the southern parts of the heavens, or, to speak with 
more minute exactness, between the sixth^ hour and the first 
hour of the winter solstice. 

"We will now describe its extent and its different cities ; 
in doing which, it is necessary to premise, that we shall fol- 
low the arrangement of the late Emperor Augustus, and 
adopt the division which he made of the whole of Italy into 
eleven districts ; taking them, however, according to their 
order on the sea-line, as in so hurried a detail it would not be 
possible otherwise to describe each city in juxtaposition with 
the others in its vicinity. And for the same reason, in de- 
scribing the interior, I shall follow the alphabetical order 
which has been adopted by that Emperor, pointing out the 
colonies of which he has made mention in his enumeration. 
Nor is it a very easy task to trace their situation and origin ; 
for, not to speak of others, the Ingaunian Ligurians have had 
lands granted to them as many as thirty different times.

1 This distance is overstated : the circuit is in reality about 2500 miles. 

2 For instance, from Pola to Ravenna, and from ladera to Ancona. 

3 Sardinia is in no part nearer to Italy than 140 miles. 

"* Issa, now Lissa, is an island of the Adinatic, off the coast of Libur- 
nia ; it is not less than eighty miles distant from the nearest part of the 
coast of Italy. 

° That is to say, the south, which was so called by the Homans : the 
meaning being that Italy extends in a south-easterly direction.

which nearly corresponded to the former repubhc of Genoa

more especially the Capillati% Cemenelio^ a town of the state

beyond tlie Alps are the Salluvii, the Deciates, and the 
Oxubii^ ; on this side of the Alps, the Yeneni^ and the Ya- 
gienni, Avho are derived from the Caturiges^, the Statielli^^

province of Gallia j^arbonensis. 

s It is supposed that they dwelt near the present Yinadio in Piedmont. 

7 It is supposed that they inhabited the vicinity of the present town of 
Chorges, between Embrun and Gap. 

8 They probably dwelt near the modem town of ^Vtontserrat. 

9 They probably dwelt near the modern Biela, eight leagues Irom Yer- 
ceil in Piedmont.

Extending behind all the before-mentioned places are the 
Apennines, the most considerable of all the mountains of 
Italy, the chain of which extends unbroken from the 
Alps^ to the Sicilian sea. On the other side of the Apen- 
nines, towards the Padus^, the richest river of Italy, the 
whole country is adorned with noble towns ; Libarna^, the 
colony of Dertona"*, Iria^ Barderate^, Industria'', PoUentia^,

!N^ext to this comes the seventh region, in which is Etruria, 

* Of which they were considered as a chain, and called the Apennine 
Alps. ^ Now the Po. 

3 According to D'AnviUe, now Castel Arqua. 

* Now Tortona. It was a city of importance, and there are con- 
siderable ruins still in existence.

Its remains are to be found at Monteu di Po, a few miles below Cherasso, 
on the right bank of the river. 

^ The modern PoUenza, a small town on the river Tenaro near Alba. 

9 Its site has been placed at Chieri near Turin, and at Carru on the 
Tanaro, a few miles south of Bene, which is perhaps the most probable. 

^0 The modern Valenza. 

^1 Placed by D'AnviUe at Yico near Mondovi, and by other writers at 
Carmagnole and Saluzzo : but Durandi has shown that the ruins still to 
be seen near Bene in Piedmont are those of Augusta Vagiennorum. Bene 
is supposed to be a corruption of Bagienna, the name of the town ia the 
middle ages. The name of the Vagienni also probably sm*vives in that 
of Viozenna, an obscure place in that vicinity. 

^2 Still called Alba ; a town near the northern foot of the Apennines. 
It probably had its appellation from Cn. Pompeius Strabo, the father of 
Pompey the Great, who conferred many privileges on the Cisalpine Gauls. 
It was the birth-place of the Emperor Helvius Pertinax. 

^3 The modem Aste. 

** The modem Acqui, so called from its mineral springs. It is again

a district wliich begins at the river Macra, and has often 
changed its name. At an early period the Unibri were ex- 
pelled from it by the Pelasgi ; and these again by the Lydians, 
who from a king of theirs^ were named Tyrrheni, but after- 
wards, from the rites observed in their sacrifices, were called, 
in the Greek language', Tusci. The first to\\Ti in Etruria is 
Luna^, with a noble harbour, then the colony of Luca"*, 
at some distance from the sea, and nearer to it again the 
colony of Pisae', between the rivers Auser^ and Arnus^, which 
owes its origin to Pelops and the Pisans^, or else to the Teu- 
tani, a people of Greece, Xext is Yada^ Yolaterrana, then 
the river Cecinna^", and Populonium" formerly belonging 
to the Etrurians, the only town they had on this coast. 
JS^ext to these is the river Prile^', then the Umbro^^, which is 
navigable, and where the district of Umbria begins, the port 
of Telamon^^, Cosa'^ of the Volcientes, founded by the Roman 

^ For an account of tliis see Herodotus, B. i. c. 94, Tacitus, Ann. B. iv. 
c. 55, and Velleius Patercvilus, B. i. c. 1. These writers all agree as to the 
fact of the migration of a colony of Lydians under the conduct of Tyr- 
rhenus to the part of Italy afterwards called Etruria. This subject how- 
ever, as well as the migrations of the Pelasgi, is involved in the greatest 
obscurity. 

2 From the Greek verb Oveiv " to sacrifice," he imphes : — from their 
custom of frequently sacrificing, says Servius, on the Xth Book of 
the ^neid. Dionysius of Hahcamassus says that they were from their 
frequent sacrifices called OvoffKooi. These are probably fanciful deriva- 
tions ; but there is no doubt that the people of Etruria were for several 
centuries the instructors of the Romans m the arts of sacrifice, augury, 
and divination. 

3 The ruins of Luna, which was destroyed by the Normans in the 
middle ages, are still visible on the banks of the Magra. The modern 
name of the port is Gollb deUa Spezzia. 

■* The modem city of Lucca has its site and name. — Livy, B. xli. c. 13, 
informs us that this colony was founded m tlic year of the city 576, during 
the Consulship of Claudius Pulcher and Sempronius Grracchus.

of this place. ® The modem Serchio, ^ Now the Amo.

1 Two localities have been mentioned as the site of Grraviscse, at both 
of which there are ancient remains : one on the right bank of the Marta, 
about a nule from its mouth, and the other on the sea-coast at a spot 
called Santo Clementino or Le Sahne, a mile south of the mouth of the 
Marta. Probably the latter are the remains of Graviscse, although Den- 
nis (Etruria, i. pp. 387-395) mchnes to be in favour of the former. 

2 The modern Torre Chiaruccia, five miles south of Civita Vecchia. 

3 The modern Torre di Santa Severa. ^ Now the Vaccina. 

* The remains of this once powerful city are marked by the village of 
Cervetri or Old Caere. According to Strabo it received "its name from 
the Greek word x&lt;^~^P^ "had!" with wliich the inhabitants saluted the 
Tp'rhenian or Lychan invaders. It was to this place that the Romans 
sent their most precious sacred relics when then- city was taken by the 
G-auls. Its most interesting remains are the sepulchres, of which an ac- 
coimt is given in Dennis's Etruria. 

^ Its remains are to be seen in the vicinity of the modem village of Palo. 

7 Its site is supposed to have been at the spot now called the Ton*e di 
Maccarese, midway between Palo and Porto, and at the mouth of the 
river Arone. Its situation was marshy and imhealthy. 

s This exceeds the real distance, which is about 230 miles. 

9 The site of the Etruscan Falerii or Fahsci is probably occupied by the 
present Civita Castellana ; while that of the Roman city of the same 
name, at a chstance of four mdes, is marked by a single house and the ruins 
of a church, called Santa Maria di Palleri. The ancient city was cap- 
tured by the Romans imder Camillus,

1^ "The Grove of Feronia." The town was so called from the grove 
of that Sabine goddess there situate. In the early times of Rome there' 
was a great resort to tliis spot not only for religious pm'poses, but for 
those of trade as well. Its traces are stiU to be seen at the village of Saint 
Orestes, near the south-east extremity of the hiU there, which is still called 
Felonica. Tliis is in southern Etruria, but Ptolemy mentions another 
place of the same name in the north-west extremity of Etrui'ia, between 
the Arnus and the Macra.

The thi'ee tribes or peoples here mentioned probably did not occupy di-

"being distinct colonies or bodies of settlers. The Julienses were the 
colonists settled there by Augustus. The Fidentes had probably settled 
at an earher period. The modern Arezzo has risen on the remains of the 
Roman city, wliile the remains of the Etruscan city are pointed out on 
an elevated spot called Poggio di San Cornelho, two or three miles south- 
east of Ai'ezzo. Many valuable rehca of antiquity have been discovered 
here. The family of Maecenas sprang from this place.

three miles north of the present Civita Veccliia, and now called Bagni di 
Ferrata. The baths are described by Rutihus m his Itinerary, who calls 
them Tauri Thennse (the Bvdl's Baths), and ascribes then* name to the 
fact of then* havuig been accidentally discovered by a bull.

twelve miles south of Viterbo. Numerous remains of Etruscan antiquity

of Etrm-ia that were ravaged by Sylla, and then rccolonized by him. 
Numerous remains of Etruscan antiquity have been discovered tliere. 

^ The people of Capena, an ancient and important city of Etrmna, 
which, after long opposing the inroads of the Romans, was reduced to 
submission shortly after the fall of Veu, B.C. 393. It existed and held 
municipal rank til the time of the Emperor Am-ehan, after which aU 
traces of its name or existence were lost, till 1750, when Galctti fixed its 
site with great accuracy at Civitucola or San Martino, about 2-i miles 
from Rome. It was situate on the banks of a small river now called the 
Grammiccia, and in its territory was the celebrated ' Lucus Feroniae' pre- 
viously mentioned.

CHAP. 9. — THE FIEST EEGIOX OF ITALY* ; THE TIBER ; EOME. 

The Tiber or Tiberis, formerly called Thybri.s, and pre- 
viously Albula'', flows down from nearly the central part of 
the chain of the Apenuinen, in the territory of the Arretini. 
It is at first small, and only navigable by means of sluices, 
in which the water is dammed up and then discharged, in the 
game manner as the Timia'^ and the Glanis, which flow into 
it ; for which purpose it is found necessary to collect the water 
for nine days, unless there should happen to be a fall of rain. 
And even then, the Tiber, by reason of its rugged and uneven 
cliannel, is really more suitable for navigation by rafts than 
by vessels, for any great distance. It winds along for a 
course of 150 miles, passing not far from Tifernum^', Perusia, 
and Ocriculum^, and dividing Etruria from the Umbri'' and 
tlie Sabiid'-*, and then, at a distance of less than sixteen 

finsible site. The new city was the birth-place of Sejanus, the worthless 
lavoiunte of Tiberius. Of the ancient city there are scarcely any remains. 

' Called also Crusturneria, Cru.stumiuni, and Crustuniinium. It was 
a niy of Latium on the borders of the Sabine country, and was subdued 
by J{oniulu«, though it afterwards appears as independent in the tirce of 
Tarquinius Priscus. The territory was noted for its fertility. The exact 
site of the city is unknown ; a place called Marcigliana Vecchia, about 
nine miles from Rome, seems the most probable. 

^ The site of Caletra is quite unknown. It was situate at some point 
iji the present valley of the Albegna. 

•* The First Region extended from the Tiber to the Gulf of Salemum, 
bring bounded in the interior by the Apennines. It consisted of ancient 
Latium and Campania, comprising the modem Campagna di Roma, and 
the provinces of the kingdom of Naples. 

^ Livy, B. i. c. 3, and OvifL, Fasti, B. iii. 1. 389, inform us tliat the 
name of Albula was clianged into TiberLs in consequence of king Tiberinua 
biiiig accidentally drowned in it. 

£• Still known by that name. The Glanis is called la Chiana. 

'"' According to U'Anville, now known as Citta di Castello. 

7 A municipal town of Umbria, situate near the confluence of the 
rivers !Nar and Tiber, and on the Flaminian Way. There are the ruins 
of an aqueduct, an amphitheatre, and some temples, now the modem 
Ot ricoli. 

^ The territory of Umbria extended from the left bank of the Tiber, 
near its rise, to the Adriatic.

miles from tlie city, separating the territory of Veil from 
that of Crustiiminiun, and afterwards that of the Fidenates 
and of Latium from Yaticanimi. 

Below its union with the Grianis from Arretinum the Tiber 
is swollen bv two and forty streams, particularly the Xar^ 
and the Anio, which last is also naMigable and shuts in 
Latium at the back ; it is also increased by the numerous 
aqueducts and springs which are conveyed to the City. Here 
it becomes navigable by vessels of any burden which may come 
up from the Italian sea ; a most tranquil dispenser of the 
produce of all parts of the earth, and peopled and embellished 
along its banks with more villas than nearly all the other 
rivers of the world taken together. And yet there is no 
river more circumscribed than it, so close are its banks shut 
in on either side ; but still, no resistance does it offer, although 
its waters frequently rise with great suddenness, and no part 
is more liable to be swollen than that which runs throu£:h 
the City itself. In such case, however, the Tiber is rather 
to be looked upon- as pregnant with prophetic warnings to 
us, and in its increase to be considered more as a promoter 
of religion than a source of devastation. 

Latium^ has preserved its original limits, from the Tiber 
to Circeii^ a distance of fifty uiiles : so slender at the be- 
ginning were the roots from which this our Empire sprang. 
Its inhabitants have been often chans;^ed. and different 
nations have peopled it at different times, the Aborigines, 

to the Anio. Tlie Cmstiuniiii and the Fidenates prohahly occupied the 
southern part of the district about the river Alba. 

^ The Nera and the Xevcrone. The exact situation of the district of 
Yaticanum has not been ascertained with exactness. 

2 As not so much causing mischief by its iaundations, as giving 
"warning thereby of the wrath of the gods and of impending dangers ; 
which might be arrested bv sacrifices and expiatorv rites. — See Horace, 
Odes, B. i. 2. 29. 

3 The frontier of ancient Latimn was at Circeii, but that of modem 
Latium extended to Siauessa. 

^ A town of Lativmi, situate at the foot of the Mons Circeins, now 
Monte Circello. It was used as a place of retirement, and Tiberius and 
Domitian had villas there. The Triumvir Lepidus was banished thither 
by Octavius after liis deposition. It was also famous for its oysters, 
which were of the finest quahty. Considerable remains of it are still 
to be seen on the hill called Monte di CitadeEa, about two miles from 
the sea.

the Pelasgi, the Arcades, the Seciili, the Aunuici, the Riituli, 
and, beyond Circeii. the Yolsci, the Osci, and the Ausones 
whence the name of Latium came to be extended as far as 
the river Liris^ 

We will begin -w-ith Ostia-, a colony founded by a king of 
Eome, the town of Laurentum^, the grove of Jupiter Indi- 
ges^, the river Numicius^, and Ardea*, founded by Danae, the 
mother of Perseus. Xert come the former site of Aphro- 
disium'. the colony of Antium^, the river and island called 
Astura^. the river Xymphteus^", the Clostra Eomana^^ and 
Circeii ^\ formerly an island, and, if we are to believe Homer, 
surrounded by the open sea, though now by an extensive plain. 
The circumstances which v/e are enabled to publish on this 
subject for the information of the world are very remarkable. 
Theophrastus, the first foreigner who treated of the alFairs of 
Eome with any degree of accuracy (for Theopompus. before 
whose time no Greek writer had made mention of us, only 

1 Now the Grarigliano, the same river which he previously calls the 
Glanis. It was the boundary between Latium and Campania. 

" Founded by Ancus Martius, as we learn from Livy. It was aban- 
doned under the Emperor Claudius, who built the Portus Komanus or 
Portus Augusti in its vicinity ; and it only continued famous for its salt- 
works, which had been estabhshed there by Ancus Martins. Its ruins, 
still called Ostia, are nearly three mile* from the coast, in consequence of 
the receding of the sea. 

3 Now San Lorenzo. It was between Ostia and Antium. 

* By some, .£neas was supposed to have been worshiped by that 
name. ' Now tne river Numico. 

^ The ruins of this once great city may still be seen near the present 
village of the same name. Its situation was pecuUarly unhealthy. An- 
other tradition, besides the one mentioned by Pliny, was, that it was 
founded by a son of Ulysses and Circe. It was twenty -four miles distant 
from Rome. 

" A temple of Tenus, of which the niins are stiU to be seen. 

* Its few ruins are stiU known as Anzio Rovinato. It was famous for 
its temple of Fortune, addressed by Horace, Odes, i. 35. Near the sit* is 
the modem village of Porto d'Anzo. 

^ This island was occupied by villas of the Roman nobility, and was 
the resort of Cicero, Augustus and Tiberius. There b still a fortified 
town called the Torre di Astura. ^ The modem Ninfa. 

" "The Roman Bulwarks." They were thrown up to protect the 
frontier of the ancient kingdom of Rome from the inroads of the Tolscians'

and Clitarchus, the next after him, only spoke of the embassy 
that was sent by the Eomans to Alexander) — Theophrastus, 
I say, following something more than mere rumoiu-, has 
given the circuit of the island of Cii'ceii as being eighty stadia, 
in the volume which he wrote during the archonship of Ni- 
codorus at Athens \ being the 440th year of our city. AYhat- 
ever land therefore has been annexed to that island beyond the 
circumference of about ten miles, has been added to Italy 
since the year previously mentioned. 

Another wonderful circumstance too. — 'Near Circeii are 
the Pomptine Marshes^, formerly the site, according to 
Mucianus, who was thrice consul, of four-and-twenty cities. 
Next to this comes the river Ufens^ upon which is the 
town of Terracina^ called, in the language of the A^olsci, 
Anxur; the spot too where Amyclie^ stood, a town de- 
stroyed by serpents. Next is the site of the Grrotto^ Lake 
Fundanus^, the port of Caieta^ and then the town of For-

4 It was situate fifty-eight miles from Eome ; the modern town of 
Terracina stands on its site. The remains of the ancient citadel arc 
visible on the slope of Montecchio. 

5 The exact site of this place is unknown. Servius, in liis Commen- 
tary on B. X. of the ^neid, 1. 564, tells the same story of the serpents. ^^ 

s This was near Amyclse. A villa was situate there called " Speluncse," 
from the cavities in the rock, in one of which the Emperor Tiberius nearly 
lost his life by the faUing m of the roof. The modern village of Sperloiiga, 
eight miles west of Gaeta, marks its site. 7 Now Lago di Fondi. 

8 Now Graeta, said to have received its name from being the burial- 
place of Caieta, the nurse of ^neas. The shore was studded with nume- 
rous villas of the Roman nobihty. It is now a city of great opulence : m 
its vicinity extensive ruins are to be seen. 

« On the spot now called Mola di Gaeta. Many of the wealthy Romans,! 
and among them Cicero, had villas here : and at this place he was put to &gt; 
death. It was destroyed by the Saracens in the year 856. The remams 
of antiquity to be seen on this spot are very extensive.

in this vale first take their nse those hills clad with vines, the 
juice of whose grape is extolled by Fame all over the world ; 
the happy spot where, as the ancients used to say, father

the fields of Setia^ and of Caecubum^ extend afar, and, next 
to them those of Faleruum' and of Calinum^. As soon as we 
have passed these, the hills of Massica^, of Gamnis^", and of 
SuiTcntum rise to our view. Next, the level plains of Labo-

bable however that it was founded by the Laconians, from whom it may 
have received its name of Hormiae (from the Grreek bp/xos), as being a good 
roadstead for shipping. 

^ Its site is occupied by the present Trajetta. In its marshes, formed 
by the overflow of the Lms, Caius Mai'ius was taken prisoner, concealed 
in the sedge. 

' The town of ]\Iintuma3 stood on both banks of the river.

Mondragone. It was a place of considerable commercial importance. 
On its site Livy says there formerly stood the Greek city of Sinope.

In no country too has the oil of the olive a more exquisite 
flavour. This territory, a battle-ground as it were for the 
gratification of every luxurious pleasure of man, has been 
held successively by the Osci, the Greeks, the Umbri, the 
Tusci, and the Campani. 

On the coast we first meet with the river Savo^ the town 
of Yolturnum with a river^ of the same name, the town of 
Liternum^ Cumai^ a Chalcidian colony, Misenum^ the port 
of Bai£e^ Bauli^ the Lucrine Lake', and Lake Avernus, near 
Avhich there stood formerly a town^ of the Cimmerians. We 
then come to Puteoli^^, formerly called the colony of Dicae- 

1 The modern Saove. 

2 Now called the Yoltumo, with a smaU place on its banks called 
Castel Volturno. 

3 The present village of Torre di Patria is supposed to occupy its site. 

4 Strabo describes Cum£e as a joint colony of the Chalcidians of Euboea 
and the Cymseans of ^ohs. Its sea-shore was covered with yiUas of the 
Eoman aristocracy, and here Sylla spent the last years of liis Hfe. Its 
site is now utterly desolate and its existing remains inconsiderable. 

5 Now Capo or Piinta di Miseno ; a town built on a promontory of 
Campania, by ^neas, it was said, in honour of liis trumpeter, Misenus, 
who was di'owned there. It was ma'\e by Augustus the prmcipal station 
of the Roman fleet. Here was the viUa of Marius, which afterwards be- 
longed to Lucullus and the Emperor Tiberius, who died here. 

6 Famous for its Avarm springs, and the luxurious resort of the Roman 
patricians. Marius, Lucullus, Pompey, and Ctesar had villas here. In 
later tunes it became the seat of every kind of pleasm^e and dissipation. 
It is now rendered unwholesome by the Malaria, and the modern CasteUo 
di Baia, with numerous ruins, alone marks its site. 

7 The modem village of Baolo stands near its site. It was here that 
Hortensius had his fish-ponds, mentioned by Phny in B. ix. c. 55. It 
rivalled its neighbour Bai» in mmistermg to the luxury of the wealthy 
Romans, and was occupied by numerous villas so late as the reign of 

Theodosius. t -l . 

« Probably the inner part of the Gulf of Cumse or Puteoh, but sepa- 
rated from the remainder by an embankment eight stadia in length. It 
was famous for its oyster-beds. Behind it was the Lake Avenius, occu- 
pying the crater of an extmct volcano, and supposed by the Greeks to be 
the entrance to the Infernal Regions. Agrippa opened a communication 
with the Lucrine Lake to render Lake Avernus accessible to ships, ihe 
Lucrine Lake was filled up by a volcanic eruption m 1538, and a moun- 
tain rose in its place. The Lake Avernus is stiU called the Lago di 

Avcrno. „ . 

a Or " the town Cimmerium." Nothing is known ot it.

emeU of its mineral springs. There are still many ruins of the ancient

archia, then the Phlegrfean^ Plains, and the Marsh of 
Acherusia' in the vicinity of Cumae. 

Again, on the coast we have Neapolis^, also a colony of 
the Chalcidians, and called Parthenope from the tomb there 
of one of the Sirens, Herculanenm"*, Pompeii^, from v^hich 
Mount Vesuvius may be seen at no great distance, and 
which is watered by the river Sarnus^,- the territory of 
Nuceria, and, at the distance of nine miles from the sea, the 
to\^Ti of thatname^, and then Surrentum^, with the Promon- 
tory of Minerva^, formerly the abode of the Sirens. The 
distance thence by sea to Circeii is seventy-eight miles. This 

town, which was destroyed hy Alaric, Genseric, and Totila, and as many 
times rebuilt. 

1 Now called Salpatara. This was the name given to the volcanic 
plaui extending from Cmiise to Capua, and supposed to have been once 
covered with fii'e ; Avhence the name, from 0\eyai, " to brnm." 

2 Now the Lago di Fusaro. It seems to have had its name from its 
ricinity to Avernus, the supposed entrance to the infernal regions. Its 
banks were, in the later tunes of the Roman repubhc, adorned with the 
villas of the wealthy. 

3 Neapohs, or the " New City," was founded by the Chalcidians of 
Cumse on the site of Parthenope, the supposed burial-place of the Siren 
of that name. It was so called as being only a ' new quarter' of the 
neighboxu-ing city of Cumae. The modem city of Naples stands nearly 
on its site. 

■* Said to have been founded by Hercules. It was on the occasion of 
its destruction by an eruption of Vesuvius, a.d. 79, that our author un- 
fortmiately met his death, a martyr to his thii'st for knowledge. Its 
closer proximity to Vesuvius caused it to be bm'ied under a more sohd 
body of materials ejected from the moimtain than was the case with 
Pompeii ; which seems to have been sufibcatcd with ashes, while Hercu- 
laneum was covered with volcanic tufa most probably hardened by the 
agency of water. A few scattered inhabitants are supposed to have after- 
wards settled upon the site where it was buried, which for many centu- 
ries was utterly forgotten, till brought to hght in 1738. Part of the site 
over the buried town is occupied by the villages of Resma and Portici, 
The works of art foimd here far exceed in value and interest those dis- 
covered at Pompeii. 

5 This seems to have been a town of Oscan origin. The first traces of 
it were found in 1689, but excavations were not commenced till 1721. 
It perished in the same eruption of Vesuvius as Herculaneura. 

^ Now the Samo. Its course was changed by the great eruption of 
Vesuvius previously mentioned.

harbour.

and the towns of Abelia^ Aricia^ Alba Longa^", the Acer- 

^ It probably had its name from Campania, of which it was the ca- 
pital, and wliich was so called from its extensive campi or plains. The 
site of this luxm-ious and magnificent city is now occupied by the village 
of Santa Maria di Capoua, the modern city of Capua being on the site 
of ancient Casilmum, Of ancient Capua there are but few remains. It 
was made a Roman colony by Jtdius Csesar. 

2 OrigLaally a city of the Yolscians : Cicero had a villa there, and 
Juvenal and the emperor Pescennius Niger were natives of it. The pre- 
sent Aquino stands on its site, and there are considerable remains of it 
to be seen. 

3 Or Suessa Am'unca, to distmguish it from the Yolscian city of 
Suessa Pometia. The poet Lucihus was a native of it. The modem 
Sessa stands in its vicinity. 

* The modern Venafri stands near its site. It was famous for the 
excellence of its ohves. 

5 On the banks of the Sm-is, and the most northerly tovra of the 
Yolsci. The modern Sora is in its vicuiity, and the remains of its waUs 
are still to be seen. 

^ The modern Teano occupies its site. It was famous for the medicinal 
springs in its vicinity. There was another Teammi, m Apulia. 

7 The town on its site still preserves the name. Bells were made 
here, whence in the later writers they are called " Noise." There is also 
an ecclesiastical tradition that church bells were first \ised by Saint Pau- 
Hnus, bishop of tliis place, whence they were called ' Campanae.' The 
emperor Augustus died here. 

s The remains of the ancient town, of which the ruins are very exten- 
sive, are called Avella Yecchia. It was famous for its fruit, especially 
its filberts, to which it gives name in the French " Avehnes." It was 
fhst a Greek colony, and then a town of the Oscans. 

9 A city of Latium, sixteen miles from Rome, and said to have been of 
SicOian origin. The modem town of La Riccia occupies the site of its 
citadel. It was celebrated for the temple and grove of Diana, whose 
high priest was always a fugitive slave who had killed his predecessor, 
and was called " Rex nemorensis," or " kmg of the grove." See Ovid, 
Fasti, B. vi. 1. 59 ; Art of Love, B. i. 1. 260 ; and Lucan, B. vi. 1. 74. 

10 The ancient city was destroyed by Tullus Hostilius, king of Rome. 
The Roman colony here was probably but smaU. The Roman patrician 
famihes, the Juhi, Servilii, Tullii, and Quintii, are said to have migrated 
from Alba Longa, which, according to tradition, had given to Rome her 
first kmg.

ancient walls, of Cyclopean construction, stiU exist. It was the birth- 
place of Marius and Cicero. The viUa of the latter was on the banks of 
the adjoining river Fibrenus. It was, and is still, famous for its woollen 
manufactm-es.

of giving name to filberts, whicli grew abundantly in its vicinity. If sxich

and II PigUo. 

■* The people of Cereatae, a town of Latium, It is supposed that the 
ancient monastery of Casamari occupied its site, 

^ The people of Cora, an ancient city of Latium. The present Cori 
stands on its site, and there are considerable remains of the ancient walls 
and other buildings. 

^ The people of Castrimoenium, a colony of Sylla. It has been suggested 
that these were the same people whom Phny speaks of at a svibsequent 
place in this chapter as the Munieiises, an extinct people of Latium. If 
so, the name was perhaps changed on the estabhshmeut here by SyUa 
of his colony. It probably stood near the modern city of Marino.

Frosinone occupies its site.

of Ferentino stands on its site. The ruins are very extensive. 

^2 Probably the people of FregeUae, an ancient city of the Volscians. 
Its site is now unknovra, but it was probably on the banks of the Liris, 
opposite to the modem Ceprano. 

^^ The people of Fabrateria or Frabateria, a Yolscian city. A Roman 
colony was placed there B.C. 124, by C, Gracchus, and probably the old 
inhabitants for that reason styled themselves " Veteres." The ruins at 
San Giovanni in Cerico, about three miles from Falvaterra, are supposed 
to be those of tliis place, or at least of the new town or colony. In such

2 "The Market of Appius." It was distant forty-three miles from 
Kome, and we learn from Horace, that it was the usual resting-place 
for travellers at the end of one day's jomTiey from Rome. It is also 
mentioned in the accomit of the joimiey of St. Paul (Acts xxriii. 15) as 
one of the usual resting-places on the Appian way. There are now no 
inhabitants on the spot, but considerable ruins still exist, as well as the 
forty-tliird milestone, wliich is stUl to be seen. 

2 Probably the inhabitants of Ferentium or Ferentiaum, now Ferento, 
five miles from Yiterbo, a city of Etruria, of which very considerable 
remains exist. 

* The people of Grabii, formerly one of the most famous cities of 
Latium. On its site the ruins of a mediteval fortress now stand, kno^vn 
as Castighone. Some remains of the walls still exist. 

• The people of Interamna Lirmas, a Roman colony on the banks 
of the Liris ; and as there were several cities of the same name, it was 
generally distinguished by the epithet " Lfrinas." Phny no doubt calls it 
" Succasina," from its vicuiity to Casinmn. Its site, though uninhabited, 
is stUI called Terame, and there are numerous remains of antiquity. 

^ Probably the people of Lavinium were thus called from their sup- 
posed Trojan descent. The town was said to have been founded by JEncas 
in honour of his wife Lavmia, the daughter of Latinus. In the times of 
the Antonines it was united with Laurentum; thefr ruins are to be 
seen at Casale di Copocotta.

and there are still some remains of the ancient walls. 

** Nomentum, now called La Mentana, was a Latin town, fourteen 
miles from Rome.

It was originally a Pelasgic city, but claimed a Greek origin, and was said 
to have been built by Telegonus, the son of Ulysses. During suumier it 
was mvich frequented by the Romans for its delightfid coolness. The 
remains of its ancient walls are still to be seen at Palestrina.

bani^, the Tusculani'*, the Verulani^, the Veliterni'^, the 
Ulubrenses^, the Urbinates^, and, last and greater than 
all, Eome herself, whose other name^ the hallowed mysteries 
of the sa'ored rites forbid us to mention without being guilty 
of the greatest impiety. After it had been long kept buried 
in secresy with the strictest fidelity and in respectful and 
salutary silence, Valerius Soranus dared to divulge it, but 
soon did he pay the penalty^" of his rashness. 

It will not perhaps be altogether foreign to the purpose, 
if I here make mention of one peculiar institution ol our 
forefathers which bears especial reference to the inculcation 
of silence on religious matters. The goddess Angerona", 
to whom sacrifice is ofifered on the twelfth day before the 
calends of January [21st December], is represented in her 
statue as having her mouth bound with a sealed fillet.

now called Telese. 

2 Trebula was distinguished probably by this surname from a town 
of that name in Samnium. Tlieve seem to have been two places of the 
name in the Sabine territory, but it is not known which is here meant. The 
ruins of one of them are supposed to be those not far from Maddaloni. 

3 The people of Treba, now Trevi, a town of Latium. 

•* The people of Tuscvilum, an ancient town of Latium, the ruins of 
which are to be seen on a hill about two miles distant from the modern 
Frascati. Cicero's favoiu-ite residence was his Tusculan viUa, and Cato 
the censor was a native of this place. 

^ The people of Verulse, a town of the Hemici, in Latium, now YeroH. 

^ The people of Yehtrse, an ancient town of the Yolsci, now Yelletri. 
It was the birth-place of the emperor Augustus. 

" The people of Ulubrse, a small town of Latium, near the Pomptine 
Marshes ; its site is unknown. 

^ The people of Urbinum ; there were two places of that name in 
Umbria, now called Urbeno and Urbania. 

^ The name probably by which the city was called in the mystical 
language of the priesthood. It has been said that this mysterious name 
of Kome was Yalentia ; if so, it appears to be only a translation of her 
name Grsecized — "Pwju?;, " strength." This subject will be found agaui 
mentioned in B. xxviii. c. 4. 

^^ Sohnus says that he was put to death as a punishment for his rash- 
ness. M. Sichcl has suggested that this mysterious name was no other 
than Angerona.

no more. AYhen the Yespasians were emperors' and censors, 
in the year from its building 826, the circumference of the 
walls which sui-rounded it was thirteen miles and two-fifths. 
Surrounding as it does the Seven Hills, the city is divided 
into foui'teen districts, with 265 cross-roads^ under the 
guardianship of the Lares. If a straight line is drawn 
from the mile-column^ placed at the entrance of the 
Forum, to each of the gates, which are at present thirty- 
seven in number (taking care to coimt only once the 
twelve double gates, and to omit the seven old ones, which 
no longer exist), the result will be [taking them altogether], 
a straight line of twenty miles and 765 paces". But if we 
draw a straight line from the same mile-column to the very 
last of the houses, including therein the Praetorian encamp- 
ment, and follow throughout the line of all the streets, the 
result will then be something more than seventy miles. Add 
to these calculations the height of the houses, and then a 
person may form a fair idea of this city, and will certainly 
be obliged to admit that there is not a place throughout the 
whole world that for size can be compared to it. On the

associated with his father Vespasian in the government. They also acted 
together as Censors. 

' The Lares Compitales presided over the divisions of the city, wliich 
were marked by the compita or points where two or more streets crossed 
each other, and where ' aecUculse ' or smaU. chapels were erected in then' 
honour. Statues of these httle diviuities were erected at the comer of 
every street. It was probably this custom wliich first suggested the idea 
of setting up images of the Virgin and Saints at the corners of the streets, 
wliich are stiU. to be seen in many Roman CathoHc countries at the pre- 
sent day.

principal points to which the " vise " or high-roads conducted. 

^ Supposing the chcuit of the city to have been as he. says, 13§ miles, he 
must either make a great miscalculation here, or the text must be very cor- 
rupt. The average diameter of the city would be in such case about 4^ miles, 
the average length of each radius drawn from the mile-column 2\ miles, 
and the total amount 83^ miles, whereas he makes it but 20^ miles,

perbus, a work of surpassing grandeur; for he raised it 
so high as to be on a level with the walls on the side 
on which the city lay most exposed to attack from the neigh- 
bouring plains. On all tlie other sides it has been fortified 
either with lofty walls or steep and precipitous hills \ but so 
it is, that its buildings, increasing and extending beyond all 
bounds, have now united many other cities to it^. 

Besides those previously mentioned, there were formerly 
in the first region the following famous to^^Tis of Latium :

remark that the camp of the Prsetoriau cohorts here mentioned was 
estabhshed by the emperor Tiberius, bj the advice of Sejanus. Ajasson's

site was said, with that of twenty-two other towns, to have been covered 
by the Pomptine Marsh, to wliich it gave its name. 

^ A town of Latium destroyed by Ancus Martius. 

^ An ancient city of Latium, conquered by Romulus ; on which occa- 
sion he slew its kmg Acron and gained the spolia opinia. Nibbv sug- 
gests that it stood on the Magvighano, two miles south-east of Monte 
GrentUe. Holstein says that it stood where the present Sant' Angelo or 
MonticeUi stands. 

"^ Also destroyed by Ancus Martius. A farm called DragoneUo, 
eleven miles from Rome, is supposed to have stood upon its site. Tel- 
lene was also destroyed by the same king. Tifata was a town of Cam- 
pania. 

^ A city of Latium, wliich was conquered by Tarquinius Priscus. It 
has been suggested that its ruins are visible about a mile to the north of 
Monte Sant' Angelo. 

^ A Sabine town, the people of wliich were mcorporated by Tarquinius 
Priscus with the Roman citizens. It is supposed to have stood on the 
present Monte Sant' Angelo.

city of Satm-nia. The Janiculus or Janiculum was a fortress on the 
opposite bank of the Tiber, and a suburb of Rome, connected with it by 
the Subhcian bridge. 

2 A very ancient city situate tiiree miles from Rome, and said to have 
been so called from its position on the Tiber, ante amnem. In the 
time of Strabo it had become a mere yiUage. It stood at the confluence 
of the Anio and the Tiber. 

3 An ancient city of Latimn reduced by Tarquuiius Priscus. It has 
been suggested that the to\\-n of Palombara. near the foot of Monte 
Geimaro, stands on its site. 

■* An ancient city of Latium. It probably gi-adually fell into decay. 
Lucius Tarquinius, the husband of Lucretia, is represented as dwelling here 
dm-ing the siege of Ardea. Its site is thought by some to have been at 
CasteUaccio or Castel deU' Osa, and by others at Lunghezza, which is 
perhaps the most probable conjecture. 

5 An ancient city of the Sabuies. Its ruins are visible at San Yittorino, 
a village near Aquila. 

6 An ancient town of the Yolsci, five leagues from VeUetri. Sermo- 
nata now stands on its site. It must not be confounded with the to-^-n 
of the Pehgni, the birth-place of Ovid. 

7 " Popuh Albenses." It does not appear to be exactly known what 
is the force of tliis expression, but he probably means either colonics from 
.-Uba, or else nations who joiaed in the confederacy of which Alba was the 
principal. IS'iebuhr looks upon them as mere demi or boroughs of the 
ten-itory of Alba. 

8 " Accipere camem." Literally, " to take the flesh." It appears that 
certain nations, of which Alba was"^ the chief, were in early tiines accus- 
tomed to meet on the Alban Mount for the purposes of sacrifice. The 
subject is full of obscurity, but it has been suggested that tliis minor con- 
federacy co-existed with a larger one including all the Latin cities, and 
there can be httle doubt that the common sacrifice was typical of a bond 
of union among the states that partook therem. It does not nec^^ssarily 
appear from the context that more than the thirty-one states after mew- 
tioned took part therein, tliough the text may be so construed as to imply 
that the Latin nations previously mentioned also shared in the sacrifice ; 
if so, it would seem to imply that Alba was the cliief city of the v;hole 
Latin confederacy. See tliis subject ably discussed in Dr. Smith's Dic- 
tionary of Ancient Geography, under the article Laiini.

In the Campanian territory there w^as also the town of 
Stabise^, until the consulship of Cneius Pompeius and L. 
Cato, when, on the day before the calends of May [30th of 
April], it was destroyed in the Social War by L. Sulla the 
legatus, and all that noAv stands on its site is a single farm- 
house. Here also Taurania has ceased to exist, and the 
remains of Casilinum^ are fast going to ruin. Besides these, 

* The people of Bubentum. Nothing is known of this Latin city or 
of the preceding ones. 

2 Bola was an ancient city of Latium, taken successively by Coriolanus 
and M. Postumius. Its site is supposed to have been five miles from 
the modern Palestrina, at the modern village of Lugnano. 

2 The people of Corioli. It was probably a Latian town, but feU 
into the possession of the Yolsci, from whom it was taken by Cn. Marcius, 
who thence obtained the name of " Coriolanus." Monte Griove, nineteen 
miles from Rome, has been suggested as its site. 

■* Pliiiy is supposed to be in error in representing Fidense, the early 
antagonist of Rome, as being extinct in his time, and he will be found in 
the sequel reckoning it in the Fom'th Region. This ancient Latian town 
never lost its municipal rank, though it had no doubt in liis time become a 
mere country town. The present Castel Giubilco is supposed to be 
situate on its site. 

5 The people of Horta, a to^^i of Etruria, now Horte. Many Etruscan 
remains have been discovered there.

pies its site.

nations are cither almost or entirely unkno^wTi. 

8 This was an ancient town between Pompeii and Sm-rentum. After 
its overthrow, as mentioned by Pliny, it was in some measure rebuilt, 
possibly after this passage was penned. It was finally destroyed by the 
great eruption of Vesuvius in the year a.d. 79, and it was ' here that 
our author breathed his last.

qiunius Priscus. Gell and Nibby think that it was situate about eleven 
miles from Rome, a mile to the south of the Appian way, where there 
are some remains that indicate the site of an ancient city, near the stream 
called the Fosso delle Fratocche. Livy tells us that with the spoils 
thence derived, Tarquinius celebrated the Ludi Magni for the fu*st time.

^ The modem Silaro ; it was the boundary between Lucania and 
Campania, and rises in the Apennines.

Pcestum. In consequence of the aid wliich they gave to Hannibal, the 
inhabitants were foi'ced to abandon their to\\"n and hve in the adjoining 
vdlages. The name of Piccntmi was given, as here stated, to the inha- 
bitants of all the territory between the Promontory of Minerva and the 
river Silarus. They were a portion of the Sabine Picentes, who were 
h'ansplanted thither after the conquest of Piccnum, B.C. 268. The mo- 
dem Vicenza stands on its site. 

^ The Argonaut. Probably this was only a vague tradition. 

^ By using the genitive ' Salemi,' he would seem to imply that the 
Eoman colony of Salemum then gave name to the district of wliich Pi- 
centia was the cliief town. Ajasson however has translated it merely 
" Salemum and Picentia." ' Intus ' can hardly mean " inland," as 
Picentia was near the coast, and so was Salemum. 

7 This was an ancient towm of Campania, at the innermost comer of 
the Gulf of Pirstuni, situate near the coast, on a heiglit at tlie foot of

twelve miles and a half, we come to Ehegium^'*, after which 
begins Sila^*, a forest of the Apennines, and then the pro- 
of the modem Amantia. From other authors we find that it was still 
existing at this time. If such is the f^ict, the meaning will be " the place 
where the former municipal town of Clampetia stood," it being supposed 
to have lost in its latter years its mmiicipal privileges. 

^ One of the ancient Ausonian towns, and afterwards colonized by the 
-^toHans. Like its namesake in Cyi^rus it was famous for its copper. 
Its site is now occupied by Torre di Lupi.

occupies its site. 

3 One of the cities of the Bruttii ; now Cosenza.

which come the Locri^, who take their surname from the 
promontory of Zephyrium^, being distant from the river 
Silarus 303 miles. 

At this spot ends the first '* great Gulf of Europe ; the 
seas in which bear the following names: — That from 
which it takes its rise is called the Atlantic, by some the 
Great Atlantic, the entrance of which is, by the Greeks, 
called Porthmos, by us the Straits of Gades. After its 
entrance, as far as it washes the coasts of Spain, it is called 
the Hispanian Sea, though some give it the name of the 
Iberian or Balearic* Sea. Where it faces the province of 
Gallia Narbonensis it has the name of the Gallic, and after 
that, of the Ligurian, Sea. From Liguria to the island of 
Sicily, it is called the Tuscan Sea, the same which is called 
by some of the Greeks the Notian^, by others the Tyrrhe- 
nian, while many of our people call it the Lower Sea. 
Beyond Sicily, as far as the country of the Salentini, it is 
styled by Polybius the Ausonian Sea. Eratosthenes how- 
over gives to the whole expanse that lies between the inlet 
of the ocean and the island of Sardinia, the name of the 
Sardoan Sea ; thence to Sicily, the Tyrrhenian ; thence to 
Crete, the Sicilian ; and beyond that island, the Cretan Sea.

Zephyriimi, now the Capo di Burzano ; but according to others, they 
had this name only because their colony lay to the west of their native

the two to which the Greeks have given the name of Pityiissae', 
from the pine-tree^, which they produce. These islands now 
bear the name of Ebusus, and form a federate state. They 
are separated by a narrow strait^ of the sea, and are forty-six* 
miles in extent. They are distant from Dianium^ 700 stadia, 
Dianium being by land the same distance'' from New Car- 
thage. At the same distance'' from the Pitj^ssae, lie, in the 
open sea, the two Baleares, and, over against the river Sucro^, 
Colubraria^. The Baleares^", so formidable in war vrith 
their slingers^\ have received from the Greeks the name of 
Gymnasiae. 

The larger island is 100^- miles in length, and 475 in cir- 
cumference. It has the following towns ; Palma^^ and Pol- 
lentia^^, enjoying the rights of Eoman citizens, Cinium^^ and 
Tucis, with Latin rights : Bocchorum, a federate to^vn, is 
no longer in existence. At thirty miles' distance is the

Punta de Sen-a, to the southern point of Formentera, namely — across Iviza 
22 miles, across the sea 5, and across Formentera 7. 

' Now Denia. ^ This is not correct : the distance is but 45 miles. 

^ This is incorrect : taken at the very greatest, the distance is only 
522 stadia, eight to the mile. 

^ The Xucar in Spain. 

^ We more generally find it stated that the isle of Formentera, one of 
the Pityussae, was called Colubraria. He probably refers to the islands 
of the group about twenty leagues from the coast of Spain, now knov^^^ 
by the name of Columbrete ; but they are not near the Xucar, from 
wliich, as well as from the Pityussae, they are distant about seventy miles. 
The latter islands are now generally considered as part of the group of 
the Baleares. 

^^ Now Majorca and Minorca, with the ancient Pityussae. 

" They served as mercenaries, first under the Carthaginians and after- 
wards under the Romans. The ancient writers generally derive the name 
of the people from thefr skill as archers — (iaXeapel?, from /3aXXw, "to 
throw " ; but Strabo assigns to the name a Phtpnician origin, as being 
equivalent to the Greek yvyivi]Tai, " light-armed soldiers." It is probably 
from their hght equipment that the Greeks gave to the islands the nanie 
of Tvixvriaiai. Livy says that they used to go naked during the summer.

smaller island, 40 miles in lengtli, and 150^ in circumference; 
it contains the states of Jamnon^, Sanisera, and Magon^. 

In the open sea, at twelve miles' distance from the larger 
island, is Capraria"^ with its treacherous coast, so notorious for 
its numerous shipwrecks ; and, opposite to the city of Palma, 
are the islands known as the Maenarise^, Tiquadra*^, and Little 
Hannibalis". 

The earth of Ebusus has the effect of driving awaj serpents, 
while that of Colubraria produces them ; hence the latter spot 
is dangerous to all persons who have not brought with them 
some of the earth of Ebusus. The G-reeks have given it 
the name of Ophiusa^. Ebusus too produces no^ rabbits to 
destroy the harvests of the Baleares. There are also about 
twenty other small islands in this sea, which is full of shoals. 
Off the coast of Graul, at the mouth of the Hhodanus, there 
is Metina^*^, and near it the island whicli is known as Blascon", 
with the three StoBchades, so called by their neighbours the 
Massilians^^, on account of the regular order in which they 
are placed; their respective names are Prote^^, Mese^^, also 

^ The circumference is about 110 miles, the length 32. 
2 Now Ciudadela. 

^ Now Port Malion. The site of Sanisera, which was probably more 
inland, is unknown. 

4 Now Cabrera. The distance is not twelve, but nine mUes. 

5 Now called the Malgrates. 6 Now Dragonera. 
7 Now El Torre. 

^ As already mentioned he seems to confound Formentera, which was 
called Ophiusa, with the present group of Columbrete, wliich islands were 
probably called Colubraria. 

5 The former editions mostly omit " nee " ; and so make it that Ebusug 
does produce the rabbits. Certamly, it does seem more likely that he would 
mention that fact than the absence of it, which even to Phny could not 
appear very remarkable. 

1" D'Anville thinks that this is Metapina, but D'Astnic thinks that 
the flat islands, called Les Tignes, are meant. 

11 Now called Brescon, near Agde, according to D'Anville. 

12 Who were of Greek origin, and so called them, because they stood 
in a row, (xrot^^os. 

13 Now called Porqueroles. Prote signifies the first, Mese the middle 
one, and Hypcea the one below the others. 

1'* Now Port Croz. D'Anville considers that Phny is mistaken in 
identifying this island with Pomponiana or Pompeiana, wliieh he con- 
siders to be the same with the peninsula now called Calle de Giens, which 
lies opposite to Porqueroles.

called Pomponiana, and Hypaea^ After these come Stu- 
rium-, Phoeuice, Phila, Lero, and, opposite to Antipolis^, 
Lerina"*, where there is a remembrance of a town called 
Vergoanum having once existed. 

CHAP. 12. (6.) — CORSICA. 

In the Ligurian Sea, but close to the Tuscan, is Corsica, 
by the Grreeks called Cyrnos, extending, from north to 
south 150 miles, and for the most part 50 miles in breadth, 
its circumference being 325. It is 62 miles distant from 
the Vada YolateiTana^ It contains thirty-two states, and 
two colonies, that of Mariana*', founded by C. Marius, and 
that of Aleria, foimded by the Dictator Sylla. On this 
side of it is Oglasa', and, at a distance of less than sixty 
miles from Corsica, Planaria^, so called from its appear- 
ance, being nearly level with the sea, and consequently 
treacherous to mariners. 

We next have Urgo^, a larger island, and Capraria, wliich 
the Grreeks have called J^gilion^'^ ; then Igilium^^ and Dia- 
nium^^, which they have also called Artemisia, both of them 
ojDposite the coast of Cosa; also Barpana^^, Maenarta, Co- 

^ Now called the lie du Levant oi* du Titan. The group is called the 
Islands of Hieres or Calypso. 

^ These are probably the httle islands now known as Eatoneau, Po- 
niegue, and If. It has however been sxiggested that these names belong to 
llie islands of Hieres already mentioned in tlie text, and that Stui'iiun is 
the present PorqueroUes, Phoeniee Port-Croz, and Phila, Levant or Titan. 

3 Now Antibes, or Antiboul in the Provencal idiom. 

* Now Saint Honorat de Lerins. The island of Lero is the present 
Sainte Marguerite de Lerins, and is nearer to Antibes than Lerina. The 
Lermian monastery was much resorted to in the early ages of Cliristianity. 

^ In ancient Etrm-ia, now Torre di Vada. The distance is, in reahty, 
about ninety miles. 

^ Mariana was situate in the northern part of the island, and the ruins 
of Aleria are stUl to be seen on the banks of the river Tavignano, near 
the coast. 7 Probably near the present Monte CVisto. 

^ He probably means the group of islands called Formicole, which are 
situate only thirty-three miles from Corsica, and not near sixty. 

^ Now La Gorgona, « 

'^ Both of these names meaning " Goat island." It is now called 
Capraia. " The modern Giglio.

inicole di Grossetto, Troja, Palmajola, and Cervoli.

lumbaria, and Venaria. "We then come to Ilva^ with its iron 
mines, an island 100 miles in circumference, 10 miles distant 
from Populonimn, and called -^thalia by the Grreeks : from 
it the island of Planasia" is distant 28 miles. After these, 
beyond the mouths of the Tiber, and oft' the coast of Antium, 
we come to Astura^, then Palmaria and Sinonia, and, oppo- 
site to Pormiae, Pontise. In the Grulf of Puteoli are Panda- 
teria'', and Prochyta, so called, not from the nurse of 
-lEneas, but because it has been poured forth^ or detached 
from JEnaria^, an island which received its name from hav- 
ing been the anchorage of the fleet of JEneas, though called 
by Homer Inarime^ ; it is also called Pithecusa, not, as 
many have fancied, on account of the multitudes of apes 
fornid there, but from its extensive manufactories of pottery. 
Between Pausilipum^ and Neapolis lies the island of Me- 
garis^, and then, at a distance of eight miles from Surrentum, 
Capreae^", famous for the castle of the emperor Tiberius: it 
is eleven miles in circumference. 

^ The modern Elba. 2 Now Pianosa. 

3 Astura still retains its ancient name, Palmaria is the present Pal- 
marola, Sinonia is now Senone, and Pontise is the modem Isola di Ponza. 

^ Now Yentotiene. 

* Deriving its name from the Gi-reek word Trpoxwros, meaning " poured 
forth." 

^ The present island of Ischia, off the coasts of Campania. The name 
of Pithecusse appears to have been given by the Grreeks to the two islands 
of iEnaria and Prochyta collectively. 

"^ Ovid, like many other writers, mentions Inarime as though a different 
island from Pithecusse. See Met, B. xiv. 1. 89. As is here mentioned by 
PKny, many persons derived the name " Pithecusse " from ttiQtjkos " an 
ape," and, according to Strabo, " Aremus " was the Etriu-ian name for an 
ape. Ovid, in the Metamorphoses, loc. cit., confirms this tradition by 
relating the change of the natives into apes. The solution of its name 
given by Phny appears however extremely probable, that it gained its 
name from its manufacture of TnOrjKa, or earthen vessels. Yirgil is sup- 
posed to have corned the name of " Inarime." 

^ Now Posilippo. It is said to have derived its name from the G-reek 
TravffiXvTTov, as tending to drive away care by the beauty of its situation. 
Yirgil was biiried in its vicinity. 

^ The modem Castel del' Ovo. • 

^° Now Capri, Here Tiberius established liis den of lustfiihiess and 
iniquity. He erected twelve villas in the island, the remains of several 
of which are still to be seen.

CHAP. 13. SARDINIA. 

Leucothea comes next, and after it, but out of sight, as it 
lies upon the verge of the African Sea, Sardinia. It is situate 
somewhat less^ than eight miles from the nearest point of 
Corsica, and the Straits between them are even still more 
reduced by the small islands there situate, called the Cuni- 
culariae^ as also those of Phintonis^ and Fossse, from 
which last the Straits themselves have obtained the name of 
Taphros^. 

(7.) Sardinia extends, upon the east side, a distance of 
188 miles, on the west 175, on the south 77, and on the 
north 125, being 565 miles in circumference. Its pro- 
montory of Caralis^ is distant from Africa 200, and from 
Grades 1400 miles. Off the promontory of Gordis^ it has 
two islands called the Isles of Hercules^, off that of Sulcis, 
the island of Enosis*^, and off that of Caralis, Ficaria^ Some 
"^Titers place Beleris not far from it, as also CaUodis, and the 
island known as Heras Lutra^". 

The most celebrated peoples of this island are the Bienses", 
the Balari, and the Corsi ; and among its eighteen towns, 
there are those of the Sulcitani'^, the A^alentini^^ the Neapoli- 

I The distance between is hardly five miles. 

' These rocks appear at the present day to be nameless. The old name 
seems to mean, the " Eabbit Warrens." 

=» Pliintonis, according to Hardouin, is the modem Isola di Figo, ac- 
cording to Mannert, Caprcra. Cluver makes Fossae to be the present Isola 
Rossa, while Mannert considers it to be the same with Santa Maddalena. 

^ Ta^pds being the Grreek for the Latin word "fossa," the ordinary 
meaning of which is an " excavation." 

5 Probably the Cape of Carbonara, from which however Africa is distant 
only 121 miles, and the gulf of Grades or Cadiz 980. 

^ Now Capo Falcone. 

7 Now Asiaara or Zavara, and Isola Plana. 

8 Now called Santo Antiocho, off La Punta dell' Llga. 
5 According to Cluver, the modem Coltelalzo. 

^0 The " Baths of Juno." The identity of these islands does not 
appear to have been ascertained. 

II Said by Pausanias to have been descended from persons who escaped 
on the fall of Troy under the command of lolaiis. 

12 Of the town of Sulcis. Its ruins are probably those seen at the 
village of Sulci, near the port Palm a di Solo. 

13 Their town was probably on the site of the present Iglcsias.

tam\ the Bosenses^, the Caralitani^, who enjoy the rights of 
Eoman citizens, and the Norenses^ There is also one colony 
which is called Ad Turrim Libysonis^ Timseus has called 
this island Sandaliotis, on account of the similarity of its shape 
to the sole of a shoe, while Myrtilus has given it the name of 
Ichnusa*^, from its resemblance to the print of a footstep. 
Opposite to the Gulf of Psestum is Leucasia^, so called from 
a Siren wl o is buried there ; opposite to Yelia are Pontia 
and Isacia, both known by one name, that of QEnotrides, a 
proof that Italy was formerly possessed by the CEnotrians. 
Opposite to Vibo are the little islands called Ithacesise^ 
from the watch-tower of Ulysses situate there. 

CHAP. 14. (8.) SICILY. 

But more celebrated than all is Sicily, called Sicania by 
Thucydides, and by many writers Trinacria or Trinacia, from 
its triangular appearance. According to Agrippa it is 618^ 
miles in circumference. In former times it was a conti- 
nuation of the territory of Bruttium, but, in consequence of 
the overflowing of the sea, became severed from it ; thus form- 
ing a strait of 15 miles in length, and a mile and a half in 
width in the vicinity of the Pillar of Ehegium. It v/as from 
this circumstance of the land being severed asunder that 
the G-reeks gave the name of Ehegimn^^ to the town situate 
on the Italian shore. 

In these Straits is the rock of Scylla, as also Charybdis", a 
whirlpool of the sea, both of them noted for their perils. Of 
this triangle, the promontory, which, as we have already ^^ 

1 Their town was probably either the present Napoli or Acqua di Corsari.

4 Their town was probably Nora, the present Torre Forcadizo. 

^ "At Liby so' s Tower." ^ From the Greek I'xvos, " a footstep." 

7 Now La Licosa, a small rocky island. 

« Now Torricella, Praca, and Brace, with other rocks. 

'J Posidonius, quoted by Strabo, says 550. 

^^ Meaning that it comes from the G-reek verb prjyvvfii, " to break." 
ThiJ is probably only a fanciful origin of the name.

witliout danger.

mentioned, is called Pelorus, faces Scylla and juts out towards 
Italy, while Pacliynum* extends in the direction of Greece, 
Peloponnesus being at a distance from it of 440 miles, and 
Lilybaeum-, towards Africa, being distant 180 miles from the 
promontory of Mercury^ and from that of Caralis in Sar- 
dinia 190. * These promontories and sides are situate at the 
folloA^-ing distances from each other : by land it is 186 miles 
from Pelorus to Pachynum, from Pachynum to Lilybaeum 
200, and from Lilybaeum to Pelorus 170 ''. 

In this island there are five colonies and sixty-three cities 
or states. Leaving Pelorus and lacing the Ionian Sea, we 
have the town of IMessana^, whose inliabitants are also called 
IMamertini and enjoy the rights of Eoman citizens ; the 
promontory of Drepanum^, the colony of Tauromenium^, 
formerly called Xaxos, the river Asines^, and Mount ..^tna, 
wondrous for the flames which it emits by night. Its crater 
is twenty stadia in circumference, and from it red-hot 
cinders are thrown as far as Tauromenium and Catina, the 
noise being heard even at Maroneum^ and the Gemellian 
Hills. "We then come to the three rocks of the Cyclopes^", 
the Port of Ulysses", the colony of Catina^% and the rivers 
Symsethus^^ and Terias ; while more inland lie the Lsestry- 
gonian Plains. 

To these rivers succeed the towns of Leontinum^"* and 
Megaris, the river Pantagies^^ the colony of Syracuse'*^, with 
the fountain of Arethusa^'^, (the people in the S}Tacusan ter-

low the town of Camarina^, the river Grelas^, and the town 
of Agragas'', which our people have named Agrigentum. We 
next come to the colony of Thermae^, the rivers Achates^,

Promontory of Liiybseum, which is succeeded by Drepana*\ 
Mount Eryx^', the towns of Panhormus^^, Solus ^^ andHimera^'^

Fonte di Canali, Cefalino, Fontana della Maddalena, Fonte Ciane, and 
Lampismotta. 

'^ The modern Fonte Bianche. The Elorus, according to Hardouin, 
is the modern Acellaro, according to Mannert, the Abisso. 

3 The southern side. "* Now the Maulo, or Fiume di Eagusa. 

* Still called Camariaa. Scarcely any vestiges of the ancient city now 
remain. 

^ According to Hardouin the Fiume Salso ; but according to D'An- 
viUe and Mannert, the Fiume Ghiozzo. 

7 Now Girgenti. Gigantic remains of the ancient city are still to be 
seen. ^ See note ^^ in. this page. 

^ The Achates is the modern Behce, the Mazara retains its name, and 
the Hypsa is now the Marsala.

them (TeXivov. Its remains are still to be seen at the spot called Selenti. 

11 Now Trapani. Some vestiges of its ancient mole are to be seen. 

12 The present Monte San Juhano. 

1^ The great city of Palermo stands on its site. It was founded by 
the Phoenicians. i"* The modern Solunto. 

1^ Himera was destroyed by the Carthaginians, B.C. 408, upon which 
its inliabitants founded Thermae, so called from its hot springs. This 
was probably the colony of Thermse mentioned above by Pluiy, though 
wrongly placed by him on the southern coast between Seluius and Agri- 
gentum. The modem town of Termini stands on the site of Thermse ; re- 
mains of its baths and aqueduct are still to be seen. Hhnera stood on a river 
of the same name, most probably the present Fiume Grande, and Fazello 
is of opinion that the town was situate on the site now occupied by the 
Torre di Bonfornello. Himera was the birthplace of the poet Stesichorus. 

1^ Or Csephaloedium. Some remains of it are to be seen at the spot I 
called Cefalu. 

17 Probably on the site now occupied by the town of San Marco. 
Fazello and Cluver however place Aluntivun near San I'iiadelfo, where 
seme ruins were formerly visible, and regard San Marco as the site of 
Agathyma or Agathyrnum.

modern Cassaro. The Drepanitani were so called fi-om hving on the 
promontory of Drepanimi. 

13 The ruins near La Cittadella are probably those of Ergetivim.

were those to be seen at the place called Occhiala or Occhula, two miles 
from the town of Grran Michele. 

15 The inhabitants of the city of Eryx, on the moimtain of that name, 
now San Giuhano. The ancient city stood probably half-way down the 
mountain. 

16 The town of Entella survived till the thirteenth century, when it 
was destroyed by the Emperor Frederic II. The ruins were formerly to 
be seen near Poggio la Reale. 

17 Perhaps the people of Eima, once a famous city. AccorcUng to the 
story as related by Ovid and Clauchan, it was from this spot that Pro- 
Bcrpine was carried off by Pluto. It stood on the same site as the town of 
Castro Giovanni. This note may however bo more apphcable to tho

On this side of Sicily, facing the river Metaurns, at a di- 
stance of nearly 25^^ miles from Italy, are the seven ^""^ islands 
called the -3ilolian, as also the Liparsean islands ; by the 
Grreeks they are called the Hephcestiades, and by our writers 
the Vulcanian^^ Isles ; they are called " jEolian " because in 
the Trojan times tEoIus was king there. 

(9.) Lipara^^, with a town whose inhabitants enjoy the 
rights of Roman citizens, is so called from Liparus, a former 
king who succeeded'^ ^olus, it having been previously called 
Melogonis or Meligunis. It is 25 miles ^^ distant from Italy, 
and in circumference a little less. Between this island and 
Sicily we find another, the name of which was formerly

flames. The third island is Strongyle\ lying one mile^ to 
the east of Lipara, over which JEolus reigned as well ; it 
differs only from Lipara in the superior brilliancy of its 
flames. Erom the smoke of this volcano it is said that some 
of the inhabitants are able to predict three days beforehand 
what winds are about to blow ; hence arose the notion that 
the winds are governed by iEolus. The fourth of these 
islands is Didyme^, smaller than Lipara, the fifth Ericusa, 
the sixth Phcenicusa, left to be a pasture-ground for the 
cattle of the neighbouring islands, and the last and smallest 
Euonymos. Thus much as to the first great Grulf of 
Europe. 

CHAP. 15. (10.) — MAGNA GE^CIA, BEGINNING AT LOCEI. 

At Locri begins the fore-part of Italy, called Magna 
Graecia, whose coast falls back in three bays'* formed by the 
Ausonian sea, so called from the Ausones, who were the 
first inhabitants of the country. According to Varro it is 
86 miles in extent ; but most writers have made it only 75. 
Along this coast there are rivers innumerable, but we shall 
mention those only that are worthy of remark. After 
leaving Locri we come to the Sagra^, and the ruins of the 
town of Caulon, Mystiae^, Consilinum Castrum'^, Cocin- 
thum^, in the opinion of some, the longest headland of Italy, 
and then the Grulf of Scylacium^, and Scylacium^" itself, 

* Now Strongoli and Stromboli. It is the only one of these mountains 
that is continually burning. Notwithstanding the dangers of their loca- 
lity, this island is inhabited by about fifty famihes. 

2 Strabo makes the same mistake ; the distance is twenty miles. 

^ According to Hardouin and D'Anville this is the modem Sahne, but 
Mannert says Panaria. The geographers differ in assigning their ancient 
names to the other three, except that Euonymos, from its name, the " left- 
hand " island, is clearly the modern Lisca Bianca. 

^ These are the Grulf of Locri, the Gulf of ScyUacium, and the Grulf of 
Tarentum. 

5 Now called the Sagriano, though some make it to be the modem 
Alaro. The site of the town of Caulon does not appear to be known : 
it is by some placed at Castel Yetere on the Alaro.

which was called by the Athenians, when they founded it, 
Scylletiura. This part of Italy is nearly a peninsula, in con- 
sequence of the Gulf of Terinseum^ running up into it on the 
other side ; in it there is a harbour called Castra Hannibalis^ : 
in no part is Italy narrower than here, it being but twenty 
miles across. For this reason the Elder Dionysius enter- 
tained the idea of severing^ this portion from the main-land 
of Italy at this spot, and adding it to Sicily. The navi- 
gable rivers in this district are the Carcines"*, the Crotalus, 
the Semirus, the Arocas, and the Targines. In the interior 
is the toAMi of Petilia^, and there are besides, Mount Cli- 
banus^, the promontory of Lacinium, in front of which lies 
the island of Dioscoron', ten miles from the main-laud, and 
another called the Isle of Calypso, which Homer is supposed 
to refer to under the name of Ogygia ; as also the islands of 
Tiris, Eranusa, and Meloessa. According to Agrippa, the 
promontory of Lacinium^ is seventy miles from Caulon. 

(11.) At the promontory of Lacinium begins the second 
Gulf of Europe, the bend of which forms an arc of great 
depth, and terminates at Acroceraunium, a promontory of 
Epirua, from which it is distant^ seventy-five miles. We 
first come to the town of Croton'", and then the river 

^ Now the Gulf of Saint Eufeniia. 

2 " Hannibal's Camp." This was the seaport of Scyllacium, and ita 
site was probably near the mouth of the river Corace. 

3 According to Strabo, B. vi., he intended to erect a high wall across, 
and so divide it fix&gt;m the rest of Italy ; but if we may judge, from the 
use by Phny of the word " intercisam," it woidd seem that u was his 
design to cut a canal across tliis neck of land. 

•* According to Hardouin, the Carcincs is the present river Corace, the 
Crotalus the iUh, the Semirus the Simari, the Arocas the Croccliio, and 
the Targines the Tacina. 

^ The present Strongolo, according to DMnville and Mannert. 

^ The present Monte Monacello and Monte Fuscaldo are supposed 
to foma part of the range caUcd Chbanus. 

' Meaning tliat it was sacred to Ca,stor and Pollux. Such are the 
changes effected by lapse of time that these two islands are now only 
bleak rocks. The present locahty of the other islands does not appear 
to be known. ^ Now Capo di Colonnc. 

^ The real distance from Acroceraunium, now Capo Linguetta, is 153 
miles, according to Ansart. 

^" Or Crotona, one of the most famoiis Greek cities in the south of 
Italy. No ruins of the ancient city, said by Livy to have been twelve 
miles in circumference, are now remaining. The modern Cotrone occu- 
pies a part of its site. Pythagoras taught at this place.

Nesetlius^ and the town of Thurii^, situate between the two 
rivers Crathis and Sybaris, upon the latter of which there was 
once a city^ of the same name. In a similar manner Hera- 
clia'*, sometimes called Siris, lies between the river of that 
name and the Aciris. We next come to the rivers Aca- 
landrus and Casuentum^, and the town of Metapontum", 
with which the third region of Italy terminates. In the 
interior of Bruttium, the Aprustani'' are the only people ; 
but in Lucania we find the Atinates, the Bantini, the Ebu- 
rini^, the Grrumentini, the Potentini, the Sontini^, the Sirini, 
the Tergilani, the Ursentini, and the Volcentani/", whom 
the Numestrani join. Besides these, we learn from Cato^^ 
that Thebes in Lucania has disappeared, and Theopompus 
informs us that there was formerly a city of the Lucani called 
Pandosia^"^, at which Alexander, the king of Epirus, died. 

^ The modem Neto. 

2 Now called Turi, between the rivers Crati and Sibari or Eoscile. 

3 A Gi-reek town, famous for the inordinate love of luxury displayed by 
its inhabitants, whence a voluptuary obtained the name of a " Sybarite.'' 
It was destroyed by the people of Crotona, who turned the waters of the 
Crathis upon the town. Its site is now occupied by a pestilential swamp. 

^ A famous Greek city founded on the territory of the former Ionian 
colony of Siris. The foundations of it may still be seen, it is supposed, 
near a spot called Policoro, tlu-ee miles from the sea. The rivers are 
now called the Sinno and the Agri. 

5 The modem Salandra or SalandreUa, and the Basiento. 

^ So caUed from its lymg between the two seas. It was once a cele- 
brated Greek city, but was in ruins in the time of Pausanias. The 
place called Torre di Mare now occupies its site. 

7 The site of Aprustum is supposed to be marked by the village of 
Argusto, near ChiaravaUe, about five miles from the Gulf of Squillace. 
Atina was situate in the valley of the Tanager, now theValle di Diano. The 
ruins of Atina, which are very extensive, are to be seen near the village 
of Atena. Livy and Acron speak of Bantia as in Apuha, and not in Lu- 
cania. An ancient abbey, Santa Maria di Yanze, still marks its site. 

^ The ruins of Eburi are supposed to be those between the modem 
EboH and the right bank of the Silarus. The remains of Grumentmn, 
a place of some importance, are still to be seen on the river Agri, half a 
mile from the modem Saponara. Potenza occupies the site of ancient 
Potent ia. 

3 The Sontini were probably situate on the river Sontia, now the Sanza, 
near PoHcastro. The Sirini probably had their name from the river Siris, 

^0 Yolcentum was situate near the Silarus, probably on the spot now 
caUed Bulcino or Bucino. The site of Numistro appears to be imknown.

CHAP. 16. THE SECOND EEGION OF ITALY. 

Adjoining to this district is the second region of Italy, which, 
embraces the Hirpini, Calabria, Apulia, and the Salentini, ex- 
tending a distance of 250 miles along the Grulf of Tarentum, 
which receives its name from a town of the Laconians so 
called, situate at the bottom of the Gulf j to which was annexed 
the maritime colony which had previously settled there. 
Tarentum ' is distant from the promontory of Lacinium 136 
miles, and throws out the territory of Calabria opposite to it 
in the form of a peninsula. The Greeks called this territory 
Messapia, from their leader^ ; before which it was called Peu- 
cetia, from Peucetius^, the brother of (Enotrius, and was 
comprised in the territory of Salentinum. Between the 
two promontories'* there is a distance of 100 miles. The 
breadth across the peninsula from Tarentum^ to Brundusium 
by land is 35 miles, considerably less if measured from the 
port of Sasina^. The towTis inland from Tarentum are Varia' 
surnamed Apulia, Messapia, and Aletium ^ ; on the coast, 
Senum, and Callipolis^, now known as Anxa, 75 miles from 

year B.C. 326) was obliged to engage under unfavourable cii'ciimstances 
near Pandosia , on the Acheron, and fell as he was crossing the river ; 
thus accomphsliing a prophecy of Dodona which had warned him to 
beware of Pandosia and the Acheron. He was uncle to Alexander the 
Great, being the brother of Olympias. The site of Pandosia is supposed 
to have been the modem Castro Franco. 

1 This word is understood in the text, and Ansart would have it to 
mean that the " Gulf of Tarentum is distant," &amp;c., but, as he says, such 
an assertion would be very indefinite, it not being stated what part of 
the G\ilf is meant. He therefore suggests that the most distant point 
from Lacinium is meant ; which however, according to him, would make 
but 117 miles straight across, and 160 by land. The city of Tarentum 
would be the most distant point. 

2 Messapus, a Boeotian, mentioned by Strabo, B. ix. 

3 A son of Lycaon. 

* Of Lacinium and Acra lapygia. About seventy miles seems to be 
the real distance ; certainly not, as Pliny aays, 100.

rentum stood.

Tarentum. Thence, at a distance of 32 miles, is the Pro- 
niontorj of Acra Iapygia\ at which point Italy projects 
the greatest distance into the sea. At a distance of 19 niiles 
from this point is the to^vn of Basta^, and then Hydruntum^, 
the spot at which the Ionian is separated from the Adriatic 
sea, and from which the distance across to Grreece is the 
shortest. The town of the Apolloniates^ lies opposite to it, 
and the breadth of the arm of the sea which runs between is 
not more than fifty miles. Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, was the 
first who entertained the notion of uniting these two points 
and making a passage on foot, by throwing a bridge across, 
and after him M. Varro^, when commanding the fleet of 
Pompey in the war against the Pirates. Other cares however 
prevented either of them from accomplishing this design. 
Passing Hydruntum, we come to the deserted site of 
Soletum'', then Fratuertium, the Portus Tarentinus, the 
haven of Miltopa, Lupia^, Balesium^, Cselia^, and then Brun- 
dusium^", fifty miles from Hydruntum. This last place is 

1 The " lapygian Point," the present Capo di Santa Maria di Leuca. 

2 Its site is occupied by the little village of Yaste near Poggiordo, ten 
nules S.W. of Otranto. In the sixteenth century considerable remains 
of Basta were still to be seen. 

3 The modern Otranto stands on its site. In the fourth century it 
became the usual place of passage from Italy to Greece, ApoUonia, and 
Dyrrhachium. Few vestiges of the ancient city are now to be seen! 

4 Anciently ApoUonia, in Illyria, now called Pallina or Pollona. 

5 This was M. Terentius Varro, called " the most learned of the Eo- 
mans." His design, here mentioned, seems however to have eviuced 
neither learning nor discretion. 

6 Now called Soleto. The ruins of the ancient city, described by 
G-alateo as existing at Muro, are not improbably those of Fratuertium, 
or, perhaps more rightly, Fratuentum. 

7 The modern Lecce is supposed to occupy its site. 

8 Called Va,letium by Mela. Its ruins are still to be seen near San 
Pietro Yernotico, on the road from Brindisi to Lecce. The site is stOl 
called Baleso or Yalesio. 

9 Ansart takes this to be the modem village of CavaUo, on the pro- 
montory of that name ; but it is more probably the modem Ceghe, situate 
on a hill about twelve miles from the Adriatic, and twenty-seven miles west 
of Briadisi. Extensive ruins still exist there. There was another town 
of the same name ui the south of Apuha. 

10 Now Brmdisi. Yfrgil died here. The modem city, which is an 
impoverished place, presents butfew vestiges of antiquity.' The distance 
to Dyn-hachium is in reaUty only about 100 miles.

one of the most famous ports of Italy, and, althougli more 
distant, affords by far the safest passage across to Greece, 
the place of disembarkation being Dyrrachium, a city of 
Ill}Tia ; the distance across is 225 miles. 

^ Adjoining Brundusium is the territory of the Pediculi^ ; 
nine youths and as many maidens, natives of Illyria, became 
the parents of sixteen nations. The towns of the Pediculi 
are Kudiae-', Egnatia^ and Barium'' ; their riyers are the lapyx 
(so called from the son of Dfedalus, who was king there, and 
who gave it the name of lapygia), the Pactius^ and the 
Aufidus, which rises in the Hirpinian mountains and flows 
past Canusium^. 

At this point begins Apulia, surnamed the Daimian, from the 
Daunii, who take their name from a former chief, the father-in- 
law of Diomedes. In this territory are the towns of Salapia", 
famous for Hannibal's amour with a courtezan, Sipontum^, 

1 They occupied probably a portion of the modern Terra di Bari. 

2 Said by Hardouin to be the modern Carouigna or Carovigni ; but 
Mannert asserts it to be the same as the modem Euvo. 

^ Or Gnatia, called by Strabo and Ptolemy a city of Apulia. It was 
probably the last to^n of the Peucetians towards the frontiers of Calabria. 
Horace, in the account of his journey to Brundusunn (I. Sat. i. 97-100), 
makes it his last halting-place, and ridicules a pretended miracle shown 
by the mhabitants, who asserted that incense placed on a certain altar 
was consumed without fire being appUed. The same story is referred to 
by Pliny, B. ii. c. Ill, where he incon-ectly makes Egnatia a to^vn of the 
Salentini. Its ruins are visible on the sea-coast, about six miles S.E. of 
Monopah, and an old town still bears the name of Torre d' Agnazzo. 

"^ Now Bari, a considerable city. In the tune of Horace it was only a 
fishing town. It probably had a considerable intercoiu-se with Greece, 
if we may judge from the remains of art found here. 

5 It is difficult to identify these rivers, from the number of smaU tor- 
rents between Brindisi and the Ofanto or Aufidus. Accordmg to 
Mannert, the Pactius is the present Canale di Terzo. 

^ An important city of Apuha, said to have been founded by Diomedes. 
Horace alludes to its deficiency of water. The modem Canosa is built 
on probably the site of the citadel of tlie ancient city, the ruins of which 
are very extensive. 

7 The ruins of this place are still to be seen at some little distance 
fro7n the coast, near the village of Salpi. The ston- about Hannibal was 
very probably of Roman invention, for Justin .and Front iniis speak in 
praise of his continence and temperance. Appian however gives some 
farther particulars of this alleged amour.

the port of Agasus^, and the Promontory of Mount Gar- 
ganus^, distant from the Promontory of Salentinum or lapygia 
234 miles. Making the circuit of Grarganus, we come to the 
port of Garna^, the Lake Pantanus*, the river Prento, the 
mouth of which forms a harbour, Teanum of the Apuli^, and 
Larinum, Cliternia'', and the river Tifernus, at which the 
district of the Prentani^ begins. Thus there were three 
different nations of the Apulians, [the Daunii,] the Teani, so 
called from their leader, and who sprang from the Greeks, and 
the Lucani, who were subdued by Calchas ^, and whose country 
is now possessed by the Atinates. Besides those already men- 
tioned, there are, of the Daunii, the colonies of Luceria^*' and 
Yenusia^^ the towns of Canusium^^ and Arpi, formerly called 
Argos Hippium^^ and founded by Diomedes, afterwards called 
Argyrippa. Here too Diomedes destroyed the nations of the 
Monadi and the Dardi, and the two cities of Apina and 

posed to have occupied the site of Manfredonia, and the village of Santa 
Maria di Siponto stands where Siponti stood, 

^ Probably the Cervaro. Hardouin says the Candelaro. 

^ The present Porto Grreco occupies its site.

* Probably the present Varano. 

5 Now Lago di Lesina. The Prento is now called the Fortore.

7 Between the Tifernus and the Frento. Its remains are said to be 
still visible at Licchiano, five miles from San Martino. The Tifernus is 
now called the Biferno. 

* A people of Central Italy, occupying the tract on the east coast of 
the peninsula, from the Apennines to the Adriatic, and from the fi-on- 
tiers of ApuHa to those of the Marrucini. 

^ Strabo (B. vi.) refers to this tradition, where he mentions the oracle 
of Calchas, the soothsayer, in Daunia in Southern Italy. Here answers 
were given in dreams, for those who consulted the oracle had to sacrifice 
a black ram, and slept a night in the temple, lying on the skin of the 
victim.

city are very considerable. 

1' So called, it was said, in remembrance of Argos, the native city of 
Diomedes. It was an Apuhan city of considerable importance. Some

signify anything Mvolous and unsubstantial ; just as we speak of " cas- 
tles in the air," which the French call " chateaux en Espagne." 

2 Livy and Ptolemy assign tbis place to Samniuni Proper, as distin- 
guished from the Hirpini. It was a very ancient city of the Saninites, 
but in the year B.C. 268, a Roman colony was settled there, on which 
occasion, prompted by superstitious feelings, the Romans changed its 
name Maleventum, which in their language would mean " badly come," 
to Beneventum or " wcU come." The modem city of Benevento still 
retains nmnerous traces of its ancient grandem', among others a tri- 
umphal arch, erected a.d. 114 in honour of the emperor Trajan. 

3 The remauia of Jiculanum are to be seen at Le Grotte, one mile 
from MirabelLa. The rums are very extensive. 

^ There were probably two places called Aquilonia in Italy ; the remains 
of the present one are those probably to be seen at La Cedogna. That 
mentioned by Livy, B. x. c. 38-43, was probably a different place. 

5 These are supposed by some to be the people of Abellinima mentioned 
in the jBrst region of Italy. Nothing however is known of these or of 
the AbeUinates Marsi, mentioned below. 

6 ^cse is supposed to liave been situate about nineteen miles from 
Herdonia, and to have been on the site of the modem city of Troja, an 
episcopal see. The Compsani were the people of Compsa, the modem 
Conza ; and the Caudini were the inhabitants of Caudium, near which 
were the Fauces Caudinae or "Caudine Forks," where the Roman army was 
captured by the Samnites. The site of this city was probably between 
the modem Arpaja and Monte Sarchio ; and the defeat is thought to 
have taken place in the narrow valley between Santa Agata and Moirano, 
on the road from tlie former place to Benevento, and traversed by the 
Uttle river Iselero. The enumeration here beginning ^dth the yEclani is 
thought by Hardomn to be of nations belonging to Apulia, and not to 
the Hirpini. The iEclani, here mentioned, were probably tlie people 
of the place now called AscoU di Satriano, not far from the river Cara- 
peUa. Of the Aletrini and Atrani nothing appears to be knowTi. 

"i Probably the people of Affila?, stiU called Affile, and seven miles 
from Subiaco. Inscriptions and fragments of columns are stiU found 
there.

of the Tariager, now the VaUe cli Diano. Its site is ascertamed by the 
ruins near tJie village of Atena, five mHes north of La Sala. Collatia 
was situate on the Anio, now called the Teverone.

still considerable. 

3 Forentum was the site of the present Forenza in the Basihcate It 
IS caUed by Horace and Diodorus SiciUus, Ferentum. The ancient town 
probably stood on a plain below the modern one. Some remains of it 
are still to be seen. 

4 On the site of Genusium stands the modern Ginosa. The ruins of 
the ancient city of Herdonea are still to be seen in the vicinity of the 
modern Ordona, on the high road from Naples to Otranto. This place 
witnessed the defeat by Hannibal of the Romans twice in two years 

5 The mention of the Hyiini, or people of Hyi^um or Hyria, is pro- 
bably an error, as he has ah-eady mentioned Uria, the same place, among 
the Daunian Apuhans, and as on the sea-shore. See p. 228. It is not

"We now come to the fourth region, which includes the 
most v^aliant probably of all the nations of Italy. Upon the 
coast, in the territory of the Frentani^, after the river Tifernus, 
we find the river Trinium^, with a good harbour at its mouth, 
the towns of Histonium'^, Buca^, and Ortona, and the river 
Aternus®. In the interior are the Anxani surnamed Frentani, 
the Higher and Lower Carentini^*^, and the Lanuenses ; in the 
territory of the Marrucini, the Teatini^^ ; in that of thePeligni, 
the Corfinienses^-, the Superaequani^^, and the Sulmonenses^'* ;

to the west of Castro. The Neretini were probably the people of the 
present Nardo.

Punta della Penna. Tliere are numerous remains of the ancient city. 

' According to Strabo Buca bordered on the temtory of Teanum, 
which would place its site at Termoh, a seaport tliree miles from the 
mouth of the Bifemo or Tifernus. Other wi-iters, however, following 
Phny, have placed it on the Punta della Penna, where considerable re- 
mains were visible in the 17th century. Ortona still retains its ancient 
name. ^ Now the Pescara.

Higher or Upper Carentum to have occupied the site of the modem Civita 
Burella, and the Lower one the Civita del Conte.

6 It has been suggested, from the discoveiy of a sepulchral inscription 
there, that Capradosso, about nine miles from Kieti in the upper vaUey of 
the Salto, is the site of ancient Chternia. The smaU viUage of Alba retains 
the name and site of the former city of Alba Fucensis, of which there 
are considerable remains. x. -i. c 

7 The modern town of Carsoli is situate three miles from the site ot 
ancient Carseoh, the remains of which are still visible at Civita near the 
Ostoria del Cavaliere. Ovid tells us that its climate was cold and bleak, 
and that it wovdd not grow ohves, though fruitful in corn. He also gives 
some other curious particulars of the place.— Fasti, B. iv. 1. 683 et seq. 

8 The modern Civita Sant Angelo retains nearly its ancient name as 
that of its patron samt. It is situate on a hill, four miles from the 
Adriatic, and south of the river Matrmus, which separated the Vestmi 
from the territories of Adria and Picenum. 

9 The vihage of Ofena, twelve miles north of Popoh, is supposed to 
retain the site of ancient Aufina. Numerous antiquities have been found 

lo'Cato in his ' Origines' stated that they were so called from the fact 
of their being descended from the Sabines. 

" The site of the town of Bovianum is occupied by the modern city ot 
Bojano ; the remauis of the walls are visible. Mommsen however con- 
siders Bojano to be the site of only Bovianum Undecumanorum, or " of 
the Eleventh Legion," and considers that the site of the ancient Sam- 
nite city of Bovianum Yetus is the place caUed Piettrabondante, near 
Agnone, twenty miles to the north, where there appear to be the remains 
of an ancient city.

a place of very great strength, are to be seen near the modern village of 
Aifidena, on a hill on the left bank of the modern Sangro. 

2 The people of Esernia, now Tsemia. 

3 The people of Fieulia or Ficolea, a city of ancient Latium on the 
Yia Nomentana. It is supposed that it was situate within the confines 
of the domain of Cesarini, and upon either the iiill now called Monte 
Gentile, or that marked by the Torre Lupara. 

* Ssepinum is supposed to be the same with the modern Supmo or 
Sipicciano. 

^ The ruins of the ancient Sabine city of Amitemum are still visible 
at San Vittorino, a village about five miles north of Aquila. Considerable 
remains of antiquity are still to be seen there. 

^ The people of Cm-es, an ancient city of the Sabines, to the left of the 
Yia Salaria, about tlu-ee miles from the left bank of the Tiber, and twenty- 
four from Rome. It was the birth-place of Nuraa Pompilius. Its site 
is occupied by the present villages of Correse and Arci, and considerable 
remains of the ancient city are still to be seen. 

' Nothing is known of this place ; but it has been suggested that it 
stood in the neighbourhood of Forum Novum (or 'New Market'), next 
mentioned, the present Vescovio. 

8 This Interamna must not be confounded -with. Interamna Lirinas, 
mentioned in C. 9, nor Interamna Nartis, mentioned in C. 19. It was a 
city of Picenimi in the territory of the Prajtutii. The city of Teramo 
stands on its site ; and extensive remains of the ancient city are stUl in 
existence.

the present Monte Leone dclla Sabina, below Rieti. This pla&lt;:'e is men- 
tioned in the seventh ^neid of Yirgd, as the " Olive-bearing Mutusc*." 

^3 Their town was Trebula SuU'ena, on the site of the present Montorio

Prom Gellianus we learu that Archippe\ a town of the 
Marsi, built by Marsyas, a chieftain of the Lydians, has 
been swallowed up by Lake Fucinus. and Valerianus informs 
us that the town of the Yiticini in Picenum was destroyed 
by the Romans. The Sabini (called, according to some 
writers, from their attention to religious'' observances and 
the worship of the gods, Sevini) dwell on the dew-clad hills 
in the vicinity of the Lakes of the Yelinus^. The Nar, with 
its sulphureous waters, exhausts these lakes, and, descending 
from Mount Fiscellus"*, unites with them near the groves of 
Vacuna^ and Heate, and then directs its course towards the 
Tiber, into which it discharges itself. Again, in another 
direction, the Anio^, taking its rise in the mountain of the 
Trebani, carries into the Tiber the waters of three lakes re- 
markable for their picturesque beauty, and to which Subla- 

while Cominium Ceritvim, probably another place, is spoken of by Livy 
in his account of the second Punic War. The latter, it is suggested, was 
about sixteen miles north-west of Beneventum, and on the site of the 
modern Cerreto. The Comioi here mentioned by Phny, it is thought, 
dwelt in neither of the above places. The sites of the towns of many of 
the peoples here mentioned ai'e also equally unknown. 

' Sohnus, B.ii., also states, that this place was founded by Marsyas, 
king of the Lydians. Hardouin mentions that iu his time the remains of 
this town were said to be seen on the verge of the lake near Transaco.

3 The river Yehnus, now Velino, rising in the Apennines, in the vici- 
nity of Keate, overflowed its banks and formed several small lakes, the 
largest of wliich was called Lake Vehnus, now Pie di Lugo or Lago, while 
a smaller one was called Lacus Reatinus, now Lago di Santa Susanna. 
In order to carry off these waters, a channel was cut through the rocks 
by Curius Dentatus, the conqueror of the Sabmes, by means of which 
the waters of the Vehnus were carried through a narrow gorge to a spot 
where they fall from a height of several hmidred feet mto the river 
Nar. Tliio fall is now known as the Fall of Terni or the Cascade Delia 
Marmore. 

■* Still caUed Monte Fiscello, near the town of Civita Reale. Virgil 
calls the Nar (now the Nera), " Sulphurea Nar albus aqua," " The 
white Nar with its sulphureous waters." — ^Eneid, vu. 517. 

' A Sabine divinity said to have been identical with Victory. The 
Romans however made her the goddess of leism'e and repose, and repre- 
sented her as being worsiiiped by the husbandmen at harvest home, 
when they were " vacui," oi at leisure. She is mentioned by Ovid in the 
Fasti, B. vi. 1. 307. The grove here alluded to was one of her sanctuaries.

queum^ is indebted for its name. In the territory of Eeate 
is the Lake of Cutilia?^, in which there is a floating island, 
and which, according to M. Yarro, is the navel or central 
point of Italy. Below the Sabine territory lies that of La- 
tinm, on one side Picennm, and behind it Umbria, while 
the range of the Apennines flanks it on either side. 

CHAP. 18. (13.) THE riFTH EEGION OE ITALY. 

The fifth region is that of Picenum, once remarkable for 
the denseness of its population ; 360,000 Picentines took the 
oaths of fidelity to the Eoman people. They are descended 
from the Sabines, who had made a vow to celebrate a holy 
spring^. Their territory commenced at the river Aternus"*, 
w^here the present district and colony of Adria^ is, at a distance 
of six miles from tlie sea. Here we find the river A'omanus, 
the territories of Pra?tutia and Palma*', Castrum Novum", 

^ A town of the ^Equi, now known as Subiaco. In its vicinity was 
the celebrated villa of Claudius and Nero, caDed the Yilla Sublacencis. 

2 This was a to\m of the Sabines between Reate and Interoerea, in the 
vicinity of a smaU lake of the same name. It was a mere pool, accord- 
ing to Dionysius, being but 400 feet in diameter. It is supposed that the 
floatmg island was formed from the incrustations of cai'bonate of hme on 
the banks, which, becoming detached, probably collected in the middle. 
The lake still exists, but the floatmg island has disappeared. There are 
some fme ruuis of Roman baths in the vicinity of the lake. 

3 It was a custom with the early Itahan nations, especially the Sabines, 
in times of danger and distress, to vow to the deity the sacrifice of aU the 
produce of the ensuing spring, that is, of the period from the first day of 
March till the last day of April. It is probable that m early times hu- 
man sacrifices were the consequence ; but at a later period the following 
custom was adopted instead. The childi'en were allowed to grow up, and 
in the spring of their twentieth or twenty-fii*st year were with covered 
faces dx'iven across the frontier of their native country, to go whitherso- 
ever chance or the guidance of the deity might lead them. The Mamer- 
tmi in Sicily were said to have had tins origm. 

* Now the Aterno, wliich falls into the sea at Atri or Ortona.

•^ According to Mannert the river Tesino is the same as the Albula, 
and Tervium is the modem town of Grrotte a Mare ; but D'Ajiville makes 
the latter to be the town of Cupra next mentioned. 

^ This was called Cupra Maritima, to distinguish it from the town of 
the Cuprenses Montani, afterwards mentioned. It is said by Strabo to 
have had its name from the Tyrrhenian name of Juno. From the dis- 
covery of an inscription belonging to her temple here, there is httle doubt 
that D'AnvLUe is right in his suggestion that the site of Cupra is at 
Grotte a Mare, eight miles from the mouth of the Truentus or 
Tronto. 

^ "The Fortress of the Firmani," five miles from Firmum, an important 
city of Picenum. The Fortress was situate at the mouth of the Leta, and 
was the port of the city. It is stUl called Porto di Fermo. 

" Often called "Asculum Picenum" to distinguish it from Asculum in 
Apuha. It was a place of considerable strength, and played a great part 
in the Social War. It is imknowTi at what period it became a Roman 
colony. The modem city of Ascoh stands on its site. 

7 Now called Monte Novano, accorduig to D'Anville and Brotier. 

8 Its site is supposed to have been that of the small town called 
Santo Elpidio a Mare, four miles from the sea, and the same distance 
north of Fermo. The remains of Potentia are supposed to be those in 
the vicinity of the modem Porto di Recanati. Numana is supposed to 
be the modem Umana, near the Cuscione, where, in the seventeenth 
century, extensive ruins were to be seen. 

^ It still retains its ancient name, which was derived from the Greek 
dyKU)v " the elbow," it being situate on a promontory which forms a 
ciuve, and almost encloses the port. The promontory is still called Monte 
Comero. A triumphal arch, erected in honour of Trajan, who con- 
structed a new mole for the port, is still in fine preservation, and there

Adjoining to this is the sixth region, which includes Um- 
hria and the Gallic territory in the vicinity of Ariminum. 
At Ancona begins the coast of that part of Graul kno\\Ti as 
Gallia Togata^. The Siculi and the Liburni possessed the 
greater part of this district, and more particularly the terri- 
tories of Palma, of Prsetutia, and of Adria. These were 
expelled by the Umbri, these again by the Etrurians, and 
these in their tiuTi by the Gauls. The Umbri are thought 
to have been the most ancient race in Italy, it being sup- 
posed that they were called " Ombrii" by the Greeks, from the 
fact of their having survived the rains^ which had inundated 

* The modem city of Osimo stands on the site of Axiximum, about 
twelve miles south-west of Ancona. Numerous inscriptions, statues, and 
other remains have been found there. 

2 Cluver conjectures that Beregra stood at Civitella di Tronto, ten 
miles north of Teramo ; but nothing further relative to it is known. Cin- 
gulum was situate on a lofty moxmtain ; the modern town of Cingoli 
occupies its site. 

3 " The mountaineers." They inhabited Cupra Montana, which is sup- 
posed to have stood on the same site as the modern Ripa Transone. 

* The people of Falaria or Faleria. There are considerable remains of 
this town about a niile from the village of Falerona, among wliich a 
theatre and amphitheatre are most conspicuous. The remains of Pausula 
are supposed to be those seen on the Monte deU' Olmo. The town of 
the Ricinenses is supposed to have been on the banks of the Potenza, 
two miles from Macerata, where some remains were to be seen in the 
seventeenth century. 

* Septcmpeda is supposed to have occupied the site of the modern San 
Severino, on the river Potenza. ToUentinum or ToUentura was probably 
on the site of the modem Tolentino. The town of the Treienses is sup- 
posed to have occupied a site near the modem San Severino, in the vici- 
nity of Monteccliio. 

^ A colony of the people of Pollentia was estabhshcd at Urbs Salvia, 
occupying the site of the modem Urbisaglia on the bank of the Chiento. 

7 Cisalpine Gaul was so called because the mhabitants adopted the use 
of the Roman toga.

occupies its site. The river Metaurus is still called the Metauro. 

3 " The Temple of Fortune." At this spot the Flaminian Way joined 
the road from Ancona and Picenum to Ariminum. The modern city of 
Fano occupies the site, but there are few remains of antiquity. 

^ The modern Pesaro occupies the site of the town ; the river is called 
the Foglia. 

* This was a flourishing town of Umbria. Augustus showed it espe- 
cial favour and bestowed on it the Grrove and Temple of Chtumnus, 
though at twelve miles' distance from the town. The modem town of 
SpeUo occupies its site, and very extensive remains of antiquity are still 
to be seen. It probably received two Roman colonies, as inscriptions 
mention the "Colonia Juha HispeUi" and the "Colonia Urbana Flavia." 
It is considered probable that Hispellum, rather than Mevania, was the

There are still remains of the ancient walls ; the modern town of Ameha 
occupies its site.

two miles south of the city of Fabriano, to wliich the inhabitants of Atti- 
dium are supposed to have migrated in the middle ages. 

^ The people of Asisium. The modern city of Assisi (the birth-place 
of St. Francis) occupies its site. There are considerable remains of the 
ancient town.

inscription discovered here has preserved the name of Fulgiaia, probably 
a local divinity. 

' The people of Forum Flaminii, situated on the Flamioian Way, where 
it fii'st entered the Apennmes, tln-ee miles h'om Fulginium. It was here 
that the Emperors GaUus and Tolusianus were defeated and slam by

Metam'us. The modern city of Fossombrone, two miles distant, has 
thence taken its name. Considerable vestiges of the ancient town are 
still to be seen. The battle in which Hasdrtibal was defeated by the Eoman 
consuls Livius and Nero, B.C. 207, was probably fought in its vicinity.

the Via Flammia, colonized by the Romans B.C. 242. In the later days 
of the Emph-e it was taken by Totilas, and its walls destroyed. They 
were however restored by Narses.

Cato writes that Ameria above-mentioned was founded 964 
years before the war with Perseus. 

CHAP. 20. (15.) THE EIGHTH EEGION OE ITALY ; THE PADUS. 

The eighth region is bounded by Ariminum, the Padus, 
and the Apennines. Upon the coast we have the river 
Crustumiuin\ and the colony of Ariminum^, with the rivers 
Ariminus and Aprusa. Next comes the river Eubico^, once 
the boundary of Italy, and after it the Sapis'^, the Yitis, and 
the Anemo, and then, Eavenna, a town of the Sabines^, with 
the river Bedesis, 105 miles from Ancona ; and, not far from 
the sea, Butrium^, a town of the Umbri. In the interior there 
are the colonies of Bononia^, formerly called Felsina, when 

^ Now the Conca. It is called " rapax Crustumium" by Lucan, B. ii. 
1. 406. 

2 One of the most important cities of Umbria. It played a conspi- 
cuous part in most of the uitemal wars of the Romans. The modern 
city of Rimini -which stands on its site, still retains two striking monu- 
ments of its grandeur ; the Roman bridge of marble, whicli crosses the 
river Ariminus, erected by Augustus and Tiberius, and a triumphal arch 
of marble, erected in honour of Augustus. The river Aiiminus is now 
called the Marocchia, and the Aprusa is the Ausa. , 

3 A papal decree, issued in 1756, declared the river Lusa to have been 
the ancient Rubicon, but the more general opinion is that the Pisatello, 
a Uttle to the north of it, has better claims to that honour. On the north 
bank of the Rubicon a pUlar was placed by a decree of the Senate, with 
an inscription giving notice that whoever should pass in arms into the 
Roman territory would be deemed an enemy to the state. It is espe- 
cially celebrated in history by Caesar's passage across it at the head of his 
army, by which act he declared war against the repubhc. See Lucan, 
B. i. 1. 200-230. 

* The Sapis is the modem Savio, or Rio di Cesena ; the Vitis is the 
Bevano, and the Anemo is the Roncone. 

* Strabo and Zosimus however state that it was first founded by the 
Thessahans. Ravenna first came into notice on being made one of the 
two chief stations of the Roman fleet. The harbour whicli was made for 
it was called "Classes," and between it and Ravenna sprang up the town 
of Cffisarea. Though not deemed unhealthy, it lay in a swampy district. 
Theodoric made it the capital of the knigdom of the Goths. The modem 
city stands on the site of the ancient town. The river Bedesis is now 
called the Montone. 

^ No remains of it are extant ; but it is supposed that it stood near 
the entrance of the Lagunes of Comacchio. 

7 The modem Bologna stands on its site, and there are but few remains 
of antiquity to be seen.

2 The modern town of Brescello occupies its site. Here the Emperor 
Otho put an end to liis life on learning the defeat of bis troops by Vitel- 
lius. It appears to have been a strong fortress in the time of the Lom- 
bard kings. 

3 The modem Modena stands on its site. It was famous in the history 
of the civil wars after Caesar's death. Decimus Brutus was besieged here 
by M. Antonius, in the years B.C. 44 and 43, and under its walls the 
consuls Hirtius and Pansa were slain. Its vicinity, hke that of Parma, 
was famous for the excellence of its wool. 

"* This was a Roman colony, which was enlarged by Augustus, and 
from liim received the name of Colonia Juha Augusta. It was called, 
after the faU of the Western Empire, Chrysopohs or the " G-olden City." 
The modern city of Parma occupies its site. 

^ A Roman colony. The present city of Piacenza stands on its site. 

^ It still retains the name of Cesena, and is a considerable place. After 
the fall of the Western Empire it was used as a fortress of great strength. 
We shall find Pliny again mentioning it in B. xiv. c. 6, as famous for the 
goodness of its wines, a reputation which it still maintahas. The name 
of Claterna, once a mimicipal town of importance, is still retained in part 
by a small stream wliich crosses the road nine miles from Bologna, and 
is called the Quaderna. An old church and a few houses, called Santa 
Maria di Quadema, probably mark the site of the vicinity of the town, 
wliich was situate on the high road. 

7 This Eorum Clodii is said by D'Anville to be the modern Fornocchia. 
Eormn Livii is supposed to have occupied the site of the present city of 
Eorh. Forum Popili or Forli Piccolo occupies the site of Forum or 
Foro Popili. 

** Tliis place is supposed to have stood on the spot where the episcopal 
town of Bertinoro now stands. In inscriptions it is called Forodruenti- 
norum. Formn Comelii, said to have been so called from the Dictator 
SyUa, occupied the site of the modern town of Imola, The poet Martial 
is said to have resided for some time in this town. 

^ The people of Faventia, now Faenza. PHny, B. xix. c. i., speaks of 
the whiteness of its hnen, for the manufacture of which it was cele- 
brated. At this place Carbo and Norbanus were defeated with great loss

the curious ; after which it hides itself in a subterranean 
channel luitil it rises again in the country of the Eorovibi- 
enses. It is inferior in fame to none whatever among tlie 
rivers, being known to the Greeks as the Eridanus and famous 
as the scene of the punishment of Phaeton^". At the rising of

3 Nothing certain is known of this people or their town, but it is 
thought by Eezzonico that by tliis name were meant those who occu- 
pied the wood-clad heights of the Apennines, above Modena and Parma. 
Cicero mentions a Saltus GaUicanus as bemg a mountain of Campania, 
but that is clearly not the spot meant here.

Tenedo.

the river Nura.

their town, of which considerable remains are still to be seen. 

7 These and the Senones were nations of Cisalpine Gaul. Tlic Boii 
emigrated originally fi'om Transalpine Gaul, by the Penine Alps, or the 
Pass of Great St. Bernard. They were completely subdued by Scipio 
Nasica in B.C. -191, when he destroyed half of their population, and 
deprived them of nearly half of their lands. Tlicy were ultimately driven 
from their settlements, and established themselves in the modern Bohe- 
mia, which from them takes its name. The Senones, who had taken the 
city of Rome in B.C. 390, were conquered and the greater part of them 
destroyed by the Consul DolabeUa in B.C. 283.

than to tlie vessels that are upon it, still it takes care to carry- 
away no portion of its banks, and when it recedes, renders 
them additionally fertile. Its length from its source is 300 
miles, to which we must add eighty -eight for its sinuosities ; 
and it receives from the Apennines and Alps not only several 
navigable rivers, but immense lakes as well, which discharge 
themselves into its waters, thus conveying altogether as many 
as thirty streams into the Adriatic Sea. 

Of these the best known are the following — flowing from 
the range of the Apennines, the Jactus, the Tanarus^ the 
Trebia which passes Placentia, the Tarus, the Incia, the 
Gabellus, the Scultenna, and the Bhenus : from the chain of 
the Alps, the Stura^, the Orgus, the two Durise, the Sessites, 
the Ticinus, the Lambrus, the Addua, the OUius, and the 
Mincius. There is no river known to receive a larger increase 
tlian this in so short a space ; so much so indeed that it is 
impelled onwards by this vast body of water, and, invading 
the land^, forms deep channels in its course : hence it is 
that, although a portion of its stream is drawn off by rivers 
and canals between Eavenna and Altinum, for a space of 
120 miles, still, at the spot where it discharges the vast body 
of its waters, it is said to form seven seas. 

By the Augustan Canal the Padus is carried to E-avenna, 
at which place it is called the Padusa^, having formerly borne 
the name of Messanicus. The nearest mouth to this spot 

^ The Tanarus is still called the Tanaro. The Trebia, now the Trebbia, 
is memorable for the defeat on its banks of the Romans by Hannibal, 
B.C. 218. The Incia is the modem Enza or Lenza, the Tarus the Taro, 
the Gabellus the Secchia, the Scultenna the Panaro, and the Rhenus the 
Reno. 

2 The Stura still has the same name ; the Orgus is the modem Oreo. 
The streams called Duriae are known as the Dora Baltea and the Dora 
Riparia ; the Sessites is the Sesia, the Ticinus the Tessino, the Lambrus 
the Lambro, the Addua the Adda, the Olhus the OgHo, and the Mincius 
the Menzo. 

3 This se^ms to be the meaning of " gravis terrse," unless it signifies 
" pressing heavily upon the land," and so cutting out channels for its 
course. He has previously stated that, though rapid, it is not in the 
habit of carrying away its banks. See a very able article on the question 
whether the name Eridanus belonged originally to tliis river or to some 
other in the north of Evirope, in Dr. Smith's Dictionary of Ancient Geo- 
graphy under the word " Eridanus." 

* That is to say, the canal made by Augustus was so called.

forms tlie extensive port known as that of Yatrenus, \Yliere 
Claudius Caesar', on his triumph over the Britons, entered 
the Adriatic in a vessel that deserved rather the name of a 
vast palace than a ship. This mouth, which was formerly 
called by some the Eridanian, has been by others styled the 
Spinetic mouth, from the city of Spina, a very powerful place 
which formerly stood in the vicinity, if we may form a con- 
clusion from the amount of its treasure deposited at Delphi ; 
it was founded by Diomedes. At this spot the river Yatre- 
nus-, which flows from the territory of Forum Cornell, swells 
the waters of the Padus. 

The next mouth to this is that of Caprasia^, then that 
of Sagis, and then Yolane, formerly called Olane ; all of 
which are situate upon the Flavian CanaP, which the Tus- 
cans formerly made from Sagis, thus drawing the impe- 
tuous stream of the river across into the marshes of the 
Atriani, which they call the Seven Seas ; and upon which is 
the noble port of Atria ^, a city of the Tuscans, from which 
place the sea was formerly called the Atriatic, though now 
the Adriatic. 

We next come to the overflowing mouths of Carbo- 
naria, and the Fosses of Philistina®, by some called Tarta- 

* It was on this occasion that, after a stay of only a few days in Britain, 
he quitted the island, i-eturned to Rome, and celebrated a splendid tri- 
umph. This outlet of the Po has now the name of Po di Primero. 

2 Now the Santerno, noted for the sluggishness of its waters. 

2 The Ostium Caprasiae is now called the Porto Interito di Bell' Ochio, 
the Ostium Sagis the Porto di Magnavacca ; Volane, or Yolana, is the 
south maua branch of the river. The Ostia Carbonaria, mentioned below, 
was the north main branch, subdivided into several small branches ; and 
the Fossa) or Fossiones Pliihstinaj connected the river, by means of tho 
Tartarus, with the Athesis. 

■* The reading is doubtful here, and even this, which is perhaps the best, 
appears to be corrupt ; for it is difficult to conceive how all the mouths 
previously mentioned could have been upon one canal, and besides it 
would seem that Olane was one of the natural mouths of tlie river. 

' More generally Adria, from which, as Pliny says, the Adriatic takes 
its name. Either a Greek, or, what is more probable, as Pliny states, an 
Etruscan colony, it became the principal em])orium of trade with the 
Adriatic, in consequence of which it was surrounded with canals and 
other works to facilitate its communications with other rivers. It ia 
still called Adria, and in its vicinity to the south, considerable remains 
of the ancient city are still to be seen,

rus\ all of which originate in the overflow of the waters in 
the Philistinian Canal, swollen by the streams of the Atesis, 
descending from the Tridentine Alps, and of the Togisonns^, 
flowing from the territory of the Patavini. A portion of them 
also forms the adjoining port of Brnndnlum^, in the same 
manner as Edron^ is formed by the two rivers Meduacus and 
the Clodian Canal. With the waters of these streams the 
Padiis unites, and with them discharges itself into the sea, 
forming, according to most writers, between the Alps and 
the sea-shore a triangular figure, 2000 stadia in circum- 
ference, not unlike the Delta formed by the JN^ile in Egypt. 
I feel somewhat ashamed to have to borrow from the Greeks 
any statement in reference to Italy ; Metrodorus of Scepsos, 
however, informs us that this river has obtained its name of 
Padus from the fact, that about its source there are great 
numbers of pine-trees, which in the Gallic language are 
called "padi." In the tongue of the Ligurians this river is 
called " Bodincus," which signifies "the bottomless." This 
derivation is in some measure supported by the fact that 
near this river there is the town of Industrial, of which the 
ancient name was Bodincomagum, and where the river be- 
gins to be of greater depth than in other parts.

colony fovmded by Augustus, after he had subdued the Salassi. It was, 
as Pliny says in C. 5, the extreme point of Italy to the north. The remains

^ The Grecian pass of the Alps was that now known as the Little St. 
Beniard ; while the Penine pass was the present Great St. Bernard. 
Livy in liis History, B. xxi. c. 38, points out the error of taking these 
mountains to have derived their name from the Poeni or Carthaginians. 
There is no doubt that they took their name from the Celtic word signi- 
fying a momitain, which now forms the "Pen" of the Welsh and the 
" Ben" of the Scotch.

From Cato we also learn that Comum, Bergoinuin\ and 
Liciniforum^, and some other peoples in the vicinity, origin- 
ated with the Orobii, but he admits that he is ignorant as 
to the origin of that nation. Cornelius Alexander however 
informs us that they came from Grreece, interpreting their 
name as meaning " those who live upon the mountains^." 
In this district, Parra has disappeared, a town of the Orobii, 
from whom, according to Cato, the people of Bergomum are 
descended ; its site even yet shows that it was situate in a 
position more elevated than fruitful'*. The Caturiges have

previously mentioned; Melpum too, a place distinguished 
for its opulence, which, as we are informed by Cornelius 
Nepos, was destroyed by the Insubres, the Boii, and the 
Senones, on the very day on which Camillus took Yeii. 

CHAP. 22. (18.) THE TENTH REGION OP ITALY. 

We now come to the tenth region of Italy, situate on the 
Adriatic Sea. In this district are Yenetia'^, the river Silis^, 
rising in the Tarvisanian'^ mountains, the town of Alti- 

residence of his colleague Maximianus, and continued to be the abode of 
the Emperors of the West till it was plundered by Attila, who transferred 
the seat of government to Ravenna. It afterwards became the capital of 
the kingdom of the Ostro-Groths, and was again sacked by the Goths in 
A.D. 539, and its inhabitants put to the sword. The present city, known 
to us as Milan, contains no remains of antiquity. 

1 The modern Como and Bergamo stand on their sites. 

2 From its name, signifying the " market of Licinius," it would appear 
to be of Roman origin. Its site is supposed to have been at a place 
called Incino, near the town of Erba, between Como and Lecco, where 
inscriptions and other antiquities have been found. 

■* Deriving it from the Grreek opos, "a mountain," and j6/os, "life." 

* " Etiamnum prodente se altius quam fortunatius situm." Hardouin. 
seems to think that " se" refers to Cato, and that he informs us to that 
effect ; but to all appearance, it relates rather to the town, which even 
yet, by its ruins, showed that it was perched too high among the moun- 
tains to be a fertile spot. 

^ The district of the Veneti. These people, taking refuge in the ad- 
joining islands in the fifth century to escape the Huns under Attila, 
fomided the modem city of Venice.

and less Tiliaventum^, the Anaxum®, into which the Varamus 
flows, the Alsa^, and the Natiso with the Turrus, which flow 
past the colony of Aquileia^ at a distance of fifteen miles 
from the sea. This is the country of the Carni^, and ad- 
joining to it is that of the lapydes, the river Timavus^*^, the 

1 Situate in a marsh or lagime on the river Sile. It became a Roman 
colony after Pliny's time, xnider the Emperor Trajan. Its villas are de- 
scribed by Martial as rivalling those of Baise. The Emperor Verus died 
here a.d. 169. The modem village of Altino is a very impoverished 
place. The Liquentia is now caUed the Livenza. 

2 Now called Oderzo, on the river Montegano, which flows mto the 
Liquenza. The conduct of the people of this place, in the wars between 
Pompey and Csesar, is mentioned by Lucan, in his Pharsalia, B. iv. 1. 462. 

3 From inscriptions we find that this place was called Colonia Julia 
Concordia, from wliich it seems probable that it was one of the colonies 
founded by Augustus to celebrate the restoration of peace. It rapidly 
rose into importance, and is often mentioned during the later ages of the 
Roman Empire, as one of the most important cities in this part of Italy. 
It is now a poor village, with the same name, and no remains of antiquity 
beyond a few inscriptions. 

^ The Romatinum is the modem Lemene. Pliny seems to iniply, 
(though fi'om the uncertainty of the punctuation it is not clear,) that on 
the Romatinum there was a port of that name. If so, it would probablv 
occupy the site of the present Santa Margherita, at the mouth of the 
Lemene. 

* The greater Tihaventum is the modem Tagliamento ; and Ilardouin 
suggests that the smaller river of that name is the Lugugnana. 

^ This river is supposed to be the same with the modern SteUa, and 
the Varamus the Revonchi, which joins the SteUa. 

7 Now called the Ansa. The Natiso is the modern Natisone, and 
the Turrus the Torre ; the former flowed past Aquileia on the west, the 
latter on the cast, in former times, but their course is probably now 
changed, and they fall into the Isonzo, four miles from the city. 

** The capital of Venetia, and one of the most important cities of 
Northern Italy. In the year a.d. 452 it was besieged by Attila, king 
of the Hvms, taken by storm, and plundered and burnt to the gromid. 
On its site, which is very unhealthy, is tlie modern village of Aquileia, 
with about 1400 inhabitants. No ruins of any buildings are visible, but 
the site abounds ^vith coins, shafts of columns, inscriptions, and other 
remains of antiquity. 

^ Ptolemy states that Concorcha and Aquileia were situate in the di- 
strict of the Cami.

fortress of Pucinum^ famous for its wines, the Gulf of Ter- 
geste", and the colony of that name, thirty-three miles from 
Aquileia. Six miles beyond this place lies the river Formio^, 
189 miles distant from Eavenna, the ancient boundary^ of 
enlarged Italy, and now the frontier of Istria. That this 
region takes its name from the river Ister which flows from 
the Danube, also called the Ister, into the Adriatic opposite 
the mouth of the Padus, and that the sea which lies between 
them is rendered fresh by their waters running from opposite 
directions, has been erroneously asserted by many, and among 
them by Nepos even, who dwelt upon the banks of the Padus. 
Por it is the fact that no river which runs from the Danube 
discharges itself into the Adriatic. They have been misled, 
I think, by the circumstance that the ship Argo came down 
some river into the Adriatic sea, not far from Tergeste ; 
but what river that was is now unknown. The most careful 
■writers say that the ship was carried across the Alps on 
men's shoulders, having passed along the Ister, then along 
the SavLis, and so from Nauportus% which place, lying be- 
tween ^mona*^ and the Alps, from that circumstance derives 
its name. 

1 Castel Duino stands on its site. It wiU be found again mentioned 
in B. xi^. C. 8, for the excellence of its wines. 

2 Now the Gulf of Trieste. Tergeste was previously an insignificant 
place, but made a Boman colony by Yespasian. The modern city of 
Trieste occupies its site. 

3 Most probably the modem Bisano. Cluver and D'AnvUle are of 
that opmion, but Walckenaer tliinks that it was a small stream near 
Muja Vecchia ; wliich seems however to be too near Trieste. 

"* In the time of Augustus, and before Istria was added as a province 
to Italy. 

5 He alludes to an old tradition that the Argonauts sailed mto the 
Ister or Danube, and then into the Save, till they oame to the spot where 
the modern town of Upper Laybach stands, and that here they built 
Nauportus, after which they carried their ship across the mountains on 
men's shoulders into the Adriatic. He intends to suggest therefore that 
the place had its name from the G-reek vavs "a sliip" and TropOnos "a 
passage." 

^ The modern town of Laybach stands on its site. It is situate on 
the Save, and on the road from Aquileia to Celeia. The Boman remains 
prove that the ancient city exceeded the modern one in magnitude. Ac- 
tjording to tradition it was founded by the Argonauts. It subsequently 
became a Boman colony, with the title of Julia Augusta. It is again 
mentioned in C. 28. 



Chap. 23.] ACCOUNT OP COUNTRIES, ETC. 251 

CHAP. 23. (19.) ISTEIA, ITS PEOPLE AND LOCALITY. 

Istria projects in the form of a peninsula. Some writers 
have stated its length to be forty miles, and its circumference 
125 ; and the same as to Liburnia whicli adjoins it, and the 
Flanatic Gulf^, while others -make it 225^'; others again 
make the circumference of Liburnia 180 miles. Some per- 
sons too extend lapydia, at the back of Istria, as far as the 
Flanatic Gidf, a distance of 130 miles, thus making Liburnia 
but 150 miles. Tuditanus^, who subdued the Istri, had this 
inscription on his statue which was erected there : " From 
Aquileia to the river Titus is a distance of 1000 stadia." 

The towns of Istria with the rights of Eoman citizens are 
^gida"*, Parentium, and the colony of Pola^, now Pietas Juha, 
formerly founded by the Colchians, and distant from Ter- 
geste 100 miles : after which we come to the town of jN'esac- 
tium", and the river Arsia, now' the boundary of Italy. 
The distance across from Ancona to Pola is 120 miles. In 

^ Now the Golfo di Quarnaro. Liburnia was separated from Istria 
on the north- west by the river Aj'sia, and from Dahnatia on the south 
by the river Titus or Kerka, corresponding to the western part of mo- 
dern Croatia, and the northern pai't of modern Dahnatia. lapydia was 
situate to the north of Dahnatia and east of Libm'uia, or the present 
mditary frontier of Croatia, between the rivers Kulpa and Korana to the 
north and east, and the Yelebich momitains to the south. Istria con- 
sisted of the peninsula which still bears the same appellation. 

^ This passage, " while others make it 225," is omitted in many of 
the MSS. and most of the editions. If it is retained, it is not impro- 
bable that liis meanhig is, " and the circumference of Liburnia which joins 
it, with the Flanatic Gulf, some make 225, while others make the com- 
pass of Libm-nia to be 180 miles." It depends on the pimctuation and 
the force of " item," and the question whether the passage is not in a 
corrupt state ; and it is not at all clear what his meaning really is. 

3 He aUudes to C. Sempronius Tuditanus, Consul B.C. 129. He gained 
his victory over the lapydes chiefly tlu'ough the skill of his legatus, D. 
Junius Brutus. He was a distinguished orator and liistoriaai. He waa 
the maternal grandfather of the orator Hortensius. 

* Tliis place is only mentioned by Pliny, but from an inscription found, 
it appears that the emperor Justin II. confei'red on it the title of Justi- 
nopoUs. It is thought that it occupied the site of the present town of 
Capo d' Istria. — Parentivun stood on the site of the present Pareuzo.

the interior of the tenth region are the colonies of Cremona, 
Brixia in the territory of the Cenomanni\ Ateste' belonging 
to the Veneti, and the towns of Acelum^, Patavium^, Opi- 
tergium, Belnnum^, and Vicetia ; with Mantua^, the only 
city of the Tuscans now left beyond the Padus. Cato in- 
forms us that the Veneti are descendants of the Trojans'', 
and that the Cenomanni^ dwelt among the Volcse in the vici- 
nity of Massilia. There are also the towns of the Pertini^, 
the Tridentini^", and the Beruenses, belonging to the Ithseti, 
Yerona^\ belonging to the Hliaeti and the Euganei, and Ju- 



* Livy seems to imply that Cremona was originally included in the 
territory of the Insubres. A Roman colony being established th^re it 
became a powerful city. It was destroyed by Antonius the general of 
Vespasian, and again by the Lombard king Agilulfas in a.d. 605. No 
remains of antiquity, except a few inscriptions, are to be seen in the 
modern city. 

2 The modern city of Este stands on the site of Ateste. Beyond in- 
scriptions there are no remains of tliis Roman colony. 

•^ Asolo stands on its site. 

■* It was said to have been founded by the Trojan Antenor. Under the 
Romans it was the most unportant city in the north of Italy, and by its 
commerce and manufactures attained great opiilence. It was plundered 
by Attila, and, by AgLLulfus, king of the Lombards, was razed to the 
ground. It was celebrated as being the bu-th-place of Livy. Modern 
Padua stands on its site, but has no remains of antiquity. 

^ Now called Belluno. Vicetia has been succeeded by the modern 
Vicenza. 

^ Mantua was not a place of importance, but was famous as being the 
birth-place of Virgil ; at least, the poet, who was bom at the vdlage of 
Andes, in its vicinity, regarded it as such. It was said to have had its 
name from Manto, the daughter of Tiresias. Virgil, in the ^neid, B. x., 
aUudes to its supposed Tuscan origin. 

^ Led by Antenor, as Livy says, B. i. 

^ The Cenomanni, a tribe of the Cisalpine Gauls, seem to have occu- 
pied the country north of the Padus, between the Insubres on the west 
and tlie Veneti on the east. From Polybius and Livy we learn that they 
had crossed the Alps within historical memory, and had expelled the 
Etruscans and occupied their territory. They were signalized for their 
amicable feehngs towards the Roman state. 

^ Their town was Fertria or Fcltria, the modern Feltre. 

^° The modern city of Trento or Trent occupies the site of Tridentum, 
their tovm. It is situate on the Athesis or Adige. It became famous in 
the middle ages, and the great ecclesiastical councd met here in 1545.

whom there is no necessity to particularize with any degree 
of exactness, the Alutrenses, the Asseriates, the Plamoni- 
enses'"^ with those surnamed Vanienses, and the others 
called Culici, the Forojulienses^ surnamed Transpadani, the 
Foretani, the Nedinates', the Quarqueni*, the Taurisani^, 
the Togienses, and the Varvari. In this district there have 
disappeared — upon the coast — Irameue, Pellaon, and Palsa- 
tium, Atina and Caelina belonging to the Veneti, Segeste 
and Ocra to the Carni, and Noreia to the Taurisci. L. Piso 
also informs us that although the senate disapproved of his 
so doing, M. Claudius Marcellus^ razed to the ground a 
tower situate at the twelfth mile-stone from Aquileia. 

In this region also and the eleventh there are some cele- 
brated lakes ^, and several rivers that either take their rise in. 
them or else are fed by their waters, in those cases in which 
they again emerge from them. These are the Addua^, fed by 
the Lake Larius, the Ticinus by Lake Yerbannus, the IViincius 
by Lake Benacus, the Ollius by Lake Sebinnus, and the Lam- 
brus by Lake Eupilis — all of them flowing into the Padus.

modem Zugho. 

2 Hardonm thinks that their town, Flamonia, stood on the site of the 
modem Flagogna.

modem Friuli. Paulus Diaconus ascribes its foundation to Juhus Caesar.

is in the eleventh region.

Lago Maggiore, the Mincio through Lago di Garda, the Sco througli

probably formed one large lake. 



254 Plint's nattjeal histoet. [Book III. 

Cselius states that the length of the Alps from the Upper 
Sea to the Lower is 1000 miles, a distance which Tima- 
genes shortens by twenty-two. Cornelius Nepos assigns to 
them a breadth of 100 miles, and T. Livius of 3000 stadia ; 
but then in different places. For in some localities they 
exceed 100 miles ; where they divide Glermany, for instance, 
from Italy ; while in other parts they do not reach seventy, 
being thus narrowed by the providential dispensation of 
nature as it were. The breadth of Italy, taken from the 
river Var at the foot of these mountains, and passing along 
by the Yada^ Sabatia, the Taurini,'Comum, Brixia, A^erona, 
Vicetia, Opitergium, Aquileia, Tergeste, Pola, and Arsia, is 
745 miles. 

CHAP. 24. (20.) — THE ALPS, AND THE ALPINE NATIONS. 

Many nations dwell among the Alps ; but the more 
remarkable, between Pola and the district of Tergeste, are 
the Secusses, the Subocrhii, the Catali, the Menocaleni, and 
near the Carni the people formerly called the Taurisci, but 
now the Norici. Adjoining to these are the Ehseti and the 
Yindelici, who are all divided into a multitude of states. It 
is supposed that the E-hseti are the descendants of the Tus- 
cans, who were expelled by the Grauls and migrated hither 
under the command of their chief, whose name was Hhsetus. 
Turning then to the side of the Alps which fronts Italy, we 
have the Euganean^ nations enjoying Latin rights, and of 
whom Cato enumerates thirty-four towns. Among these are 
the Triumpilini, a people who were sold^ with their terri- 
tory ; and then the Camuni, and several similar tribes, each 
of them in the jurisdiction of its neiglibouring municipal 
town. The same author also considers the Lepontii'* and

modern names, the Ime thus drawn runs past Vado, Turin, Como, Bres- 
cia, Yerona, Vicenza, Oderzo, Aquileia, Trieste, Pola, and the Arsa. 

2 It is from this people that the group of volcanic hills between Padua 
and Yerona derive then' present name of CoUi Euganei or the " Euganean 
Hills." From the Triumpilini and the Camimi, the present Yal Camo- 
nica and Yal Trompia derive then* names. 

3 Probably meaning, that for a sum of money they originally acknow- 
ledged their subjection to the Roman power. 

■* 'l^'lic Lepontii probably dwelt in the modern Yal Leventina and the 
Yal d'Osula, near Lago Maggiore ; the Salassi in the Yal d'Aosta. 



Chap. 24] ACCOUNT OF COUNTEIES, ETC. 255 

the Salassi to be of Tauriscan origin, but most other 
writers, giving a Grreek^ interpretation to their name, con- 
sider the Lepontii to have been those of the followers of 
Hercules who were left behind in consequence of their limbs 
being frozen by the snow of the Alps. They are also of 
opinion that the inhabitants of the Grecian Alps are de- 
scended from a portion of the Greeks of his army, and that 
the Euganeans, being sprung from an origin so illustrious, 
thence took their name^. The head of these are the Stceni^. 
The Vennonenses^ and the Sarunetes'', peoples of the 
Ehseti, dwell about tlie sources of the river Ehenus, while 
the tribe of the Lepontii, known as the Uberi, dwell in the 
vicinity of the sources of the Ehodanus, in the same district 
of the Alps. There are also other native tribes here, 
who have received Latin rights, such as the Octodurenses^, 
and their neighbours the Centrones^, the Cottian^ states, 
the Ligurian Yagienui, descended from the Caturiges'', as 
also those called Montani"' ; besides numerous nations of the 
Capillati^\ on the confines of the Ligurian Sea. 

^ Making it to come from the Greek verb XetVoj, " to leave beliiiid." 

2 As though being evyeveioi or evyevets, " of honourable descent," or

^ Strabo mentions the Stoni or Stoeni among the minor Alpine tribes. 
IMannert thinks that they dwelt near the sources of the river Chiese, 
about the site of the modera village of Storo. 

^ It has been suggested that from them the modem Valtelline takes 
its name. 

^ Hardouin suggests that the Suanetcs, who are again mentioned, 
are the people here meant. 

^ They are supposed to have dwelt in the present canton of Martignac 
in the Valais, and tlie Vaudois. 

7 They dwelt in the Tarantaise, in the duchy of Savoy. The village 
called Centron still retains their name.

favour of Augustus, was left by him m possession of tliis portion of tho 
Alps, A\-ith the title of Praefect. These states, in the vicinity of the mo- 
dern Momit Cenis, seem to have extended from Ebrodunum or Embrun 
in Gaul, to Segusio, the modem Susa, in Italy, inelucUiig tlic Pass of 
Mont Gcnevre. The territory of Cottius was uniti-d by Nero to the 
Boman empire, as a separate province called the " Alj)es Cottia?."

douin speaks of another triumphal arch in honoxir of Augustus at Segusio

similar manner, but only the first twelve words were remaining in 1671.

of the Adige. The Isarci dwelt in the Val de Sarra or Sarcha, near Val 
Camonica ; and the Bremii in the Val Brounia or Bregna, at the som*ce 
of thcTessino. 

^ D'Anville thinks that they inhabited the Val d'Agno, near Trento, 
between Lake Como and the Adige. He also detects the name of the 
Focimates m the vUlage of Vogogna.

cording to Strabo, Damasia, afterwards Augusta Vindehcorum, now 
Augsburg.

bited the modern Brixen in the Tyrol. The Lepontii have been pre-

that this is that same Italy, which, when L. ^milius Paulus^ 
and C. Attilius Hegulus were Consuls, on hearing of the rising 
in Gaul, unaided, and without any foreign assistance whatever, 
without the help even of that portion which lies beyond the 
Padus, armed 80,000 horse and 700,000 foot. In abun- 
dance of metals of every kind, Italy yields to no land whatever; 
but all search for them has been prohibited by an ancient 
decree of the Senate, who gave orders thereby that Italy 
shall be exempted® from such treatment.

in Senez, the Triulatti at the village of Alloz, the Ecchni near the river

Italy ; but Regulus was slain in the engagement. 

^ It is difTicult to say what is the exact force of " parci" here ; whether 
in fact it means that Italy shall be wholly exempted from such treatment, 
as an indignity offered to her sod, or whether her niineials were to be 
strictly kept in reserve as a last resource. Ajabson, in his Translation^

Illy ricum . But few of the names of these nations are worthy 
of mention, or indeed very easy of pronunciation. To the 
jurisdiction of Scardona^ resort the lapydes and fourteen 
cities of the Liburni, of which it may not prove tedious if I 
mention the Lacinienses, the Stlupini, the Burnistae, and 
the Olbonenses. Belonging to the same jurisdiction there 
are, in the enjoyment of Italian rights, the Alutse^, the 
Flanates^, from whom the Gulf takes its name, the Lopsi, 
and the Varvarini ; the Assesiates, who are exempt from 
tribute ; and upon the islands, the Fertinates and the Cu- 
rictse'. 

Besides these, there are on the coast, after leaving Nesac- 
tium, Alvona^, Flanona, Tarsatica, Senia, Lopsica, Ortopula, 
Vegium, Argyruntum, Corinium'', ^nona, the city of 
Pasinum, and the river Tedanius, at which lapydia ter- 
minates. The islands of this Grulf, with their towns, besides 
those above mentioned, are Absyrtium^, Arba^, Crexa, Grissa, 

^ Hai'douin thinks that " Ismeni " is the proper reading here ; but all 
the MSS. seem to be against him. 

2 Mentioned in the next Chapter. ^ Their town was Alnus or Aloiis. 

** Their town was Flanona, which gave name to the Sinus Flanaticus 
or Golfo di Quamero. The cliief town of the Lopsi was Lopsica, and 
of the Varvarini, Varvaria. 

^ The island of Fertina is supposed to have been the modem Berwitch 
or Parvich. Curicta is now called Karek or Veglia. The Illyrian snails 
mentioned by our author, B. ix. c. 56, are very numerous here. Caius 
Antonius, the brother of Marcus, actmg under Julius Csesar, was be- 
sieged here by Libo. See the interesting account in Lucan's Pharsalia, 
B. iv. 1. 402-464. 

^ The places on their sites are now called Albona, Fianona, Tersact or 
Tersat near Fiume, Segna, Lopsico, Ortopia, and Veza. 

7 Now Carin. ^nona is now called Nona, and the Tedanius is the 
modern Zermagna. 

^ The whole of tliis group of islands were sometimes called the Absyr- 
tides, from Absyrtus, the brother of Medea, who according to tradition 
was slain there. See the last Chapter, p. 266.. Ovid, however, in liis 
" Tristia," states that this took place at Tomi, on the Pontus Euxmus or 
Black Sea, the place of his banishment. 

^ Said by D'Anville to be now caRed Ai'be, and Crexa to be the mo-

of Iadera\ distant from Pola IGO miles ; then, at a 
distance of thirty miles, the island of Colentnm^, and of 
eighteen, the mouth of the river Titus. 

CHAP. 26. (22.) — DALMATIA. 

Scardona, situate upon the river^, at a distance of twelve 
miles from the sea, forms the boundary of Liburnia and the 
oeginning of Dalmatia. Kext to this place comes the ancient 
t:*ountry of the Autariatarcs and the fortress of Tariona, the 
Promontory of Diomedes'*, or, as others call it, the peninsula 
of Hyllis, 100 miles^ in circuit. Then comes Trngurium, a 
place with the rights of Eoman citizens, and celebrated for 
its marble, Sicum, a place to which Claudius, the emperor 
lately deified, sent a colony of his veterans, and Salona^, a 
colony, situate 112 miles from ladera. To this place resort 
for legal purposes, having the laws dispensed according to 
their di\'isions into decuries or tithings, the Dalmatje, form- 
ing 342 decuries, the Deurici 22, the Ditiones 239, the 
Mazaei 269, and the Sardiates 52. In this region are Bur- 
num', Andetrium^, and Tribulium, fortresses ennobled by 
the battles of the Eoman people. To the same jurisdiction 
also belong the Issaei'^, the Colentini, the Separi, and the

3 The Titus or Kerka. Scardona still retains its name. 
^ Now called the Cabo di San Nicolo. 

^ This measxirement would make it appear that the present Sabioncello 
is meant, but that it ought to come below, after Narona. lie probably 
means the quasi peninsula upon wliich the towii of Tragurium, now Trau 
Vecchio, was situate ; but its circumference is liardly fifty miles. So, if 
Sicum is the same as the modem Sebenico, it ought to have been men- 
tioned previously to Tragurium. 

^ Spalatro, the retreat of Diocletian, was in the vicinity of Salona. Its 
ancient name was Spolatum, and at tlie village of Dioclea near it, that 
emperor was bom. On the ruins of the once important city of Salona, 
rose the modem Spalato or SjDakitro. 

7 Its site is unkno\m, though D'Anville tliinks that it was probably 
that of the modem Tain.

the fortresses of Peguntium.' and of Eataneum, with tljo 
colony of Narona^, the seat of the third jurisdiction, distari t 
from Salona eighty-two miles, and situate upon a river of tlia 
same name, at a distance of twenty miles from the sea. JVl. 
Yarro states that eighty-nine states used to resort thither, but 
now nearly tlie only ones that are known are the Cerauni" 
with 24 de'curies, the Daorizi with 17, the Dsesitiates with 103, 
the Doeleatse with 33, the Deretini with 14, the Deremistae 
with 30, the Dindari with 33, the Grlinditiones with 44, the 
Melcomani with 24, the Naresii with 102, the Scirtarii with 
72, the Siculotae with 24, and the Vardasi, once the scourges 
of Italy, with no more than 20 decuries. In addition to 
these, this district was possessed by the Ozucei, the Partheni, 
the Hemasini, the Arthitae, and the Armistse. The colony 
of Epidaurum"* is distant from the river Naron 100 miles. 
After Epidaurum come the following towns, with the rights 
of E-oman citizens : — Ehizinium^, Acruvium^, Butua, 01- 
cinium, formerly called Colchinium, having been founded by 
the Colchians ; the river Drilo'', and, upon it, Scodra^, a 
town with the rights of Eoman citizens, situate at a distance 
of eighteen miles from the sea ; besides in former times many 
Grreek towns and once powerful states, of which all remem- 

burnia. It was originally peopled by a Parian or a Syracusan colony. Ir. 
was famous for its wine, and the beaked ships " Lembi Issaici," rendered 
the Romans good service in the war with Phihp of Macedon.

Mucarisca. 2 j^q^s^ called Narenta ; the river having the same nam6

Pompey and Csesar, when, having declared in favour of the latter, it was 
besieged by M. Octavius. The site of it is known as Ragusa Vecchia, 03» 
Old Ragusa, but in the Illyric language it is called Zaptal. Upon its 
destruction, its inhabitants moved to Rausium, the present Eagiisa. 
There are no remauis extant of the old town. 

* It still retains the name of Risine, upon the Grolfo di Cattaro, the 
ancient Sinus Rliizonicus. 

^ In the former editions called " Ascrivium." The modern Cattaro is 
supposed to occupy its site. Butiia is the modem Budua, and Olcinium, 
Dulcigno. It is probable that the derivation of the name of tliis last 
place, as suggested by Phny, is only fanciful.

formerly the Labeatae, theEnclerini\ the Sas»i, the Grabaei-, 
properly called Illyrii, the Taulantii^, and the Pyrsei. The 
Promontory of jN^ympha^um on the sea-coast still retains its 
name"* ; and there is Lissum, a town enjoying the rights of 
Roman citizens, at a distance from Epidaurum of 100 miles. 
(23.) At Lissum begins the province of Macedonia'^, the 
nations of the Parthini^, and behind them the DassaretsD''. 
The mountains of Candavia^ are seventy-eight miles from 
Dyrrhachium. On the coast lies Denda, a town with the 
riglits of Eoman citizens, the colony of Epidamuum^ which, 
on account of its inauspicious name, was by the Romans 
called D}Trhachium, the river Aous'°, by some called JEas, 
and Apollonia", formerly a colony of the Corinthians, at a 
distance of four miles from the sea, in the vicinity of which 

1 According to Hardouin, the modem Endero stands on the site of 
their capital. 

2 Grabia, mentioned hj Pouqueville, in his " Voyage de la Gr^ce," seems 
to retain the name of this tribe. 

3 Pouqueville is of opinion that they occupied the district now known 
as Musache. 

* Dalechamp tliiiiks that the two words "Retinet nomen" do not belong 
to the text, but have crept in from bemg the gloss of some more recent 
commentator. They certainly appear to be out of place. This promontory 
is now called Cabo Rodoni. * The modern Albania. 

^ Pouquerille is of opinion that they inhabited the district about the 
present village of Presa, seven leagues N.E. of Durazzo. 

7 From Ptolemy we learn that Lychnidus was their to^\^l ; the site of 
which, according to Pouquevdle, is still pointed out at a spot about four 
leagues south of Ochrida, on the eastern bank of the Lake of Oclirida. 

^ ]S"ow called El Bassan ; though Pouqueville says Tomoros or Do 
Caulonias. Conmiencing in EpLrus, they sepai'ated Illyricum from Mace- 
donia. See Lucan's Pliarsalia, 15. vi. 1. 331. 

3 The Romans are said to have changed its Greek name Epidamnum, 
from an idea that it was inauspicious, as implying " dannmni" or " ruin." 
It has been asserted that they gave it the name of Durrhachiuni or Dyrrlia- 
cliium, frcm " duinim," rugged, on accoimt of the ruggednoss of its 
locahty. This however cannot be the case, as the word, like its pre- 
decessor, is of Greek origin. Its unfortunate name, " E])idamnus," is the 
subject of several puns and witticisms in that most amusing perhaps of all 
the plays of Plautus, tlie Menaichmi. It was of Corcyra'an origin, ajid 
after playing a distinguished part in th.e civil wars bctwcru Ponqiey and 
Csesar, was granted by Augustus to his veteran troops. The modern 
Durazzo stands on its site. ''' Now called the Yoioussa. 

'^ The monastery of Pollina stands on its site. It was founded by

tlie celebrated Nympliseum^ is inhabited by tbe barbarous 
Amantes^ and Bidiones. Upon the coast too is the town cf 
Oricum^, founded by the Colchians. At this spot begins 
Epirus, with the Acroceraimian"* mountains, by which we have 
previously mentioned^ this Gulf of Europe as bounded. 
Oricum is distant from the Promontory of Salentinum in 
Italy eighty^ miles. 

CHAP. 27. (24.) THE NOEICI. 

In the rear of the Carni and the lapydes, along the coiu*se 
of the great river Ister^, the Bhseti touch upon the No- 
rici^: their towns are Yirunum^, Celeia, Teurnia, Agun- 
tum^°, A^ianiomina^\ Claudia ^^, and Elavium Solvense^^. Ad- 
joining to the Norici is Lake Peiso^'', and the deserts of 

the Corinthians and Corcyrseans. There are scarcely any vestiges of it 
remaining. ^ See farther mention of tliis spot in B. ii. c. 110. 

2 Pouqueville states that the ruins of Amantia are to be seen near the 
village of Nivitza, on the right bank of the river Suchista. The remains 
of Bulhs, the chief town of the Buhones, according to the same traveUer, 
are to be seen at a place called Gradista, four miles from the sea. 

3 The same writer states that Oricum was situate on the present Gulf 
De la Yallona or d' Avlona, and that its port was the place now called by 
the Greeks Porto Raguseo, and by the Turks Liman Padisha. 

"* The " Heights of Thunder." They were so called from the frequent 
thunderstorms with wliich they were visited. The range however 
was more properly called the " Ceraunii Montes," and the j^romontory 
terminating it " Acroceraunii " or " Acroceraunia," meaning "the end of 
the Ceraunii." The range is now called the Mountains of Klihnara, and 
the promontory, Glossa, or in Itahan, Linguetta, meaning " the Tongue."

CHAP. 28. (25.) — PANKONIA. 

Xext to them comes acorn-bearing Pannonia"*, alon_ 
which the chain of the Alps, gradually lessening as it runs 
through the middle of Illyricum from north to south, forms 
a gentle slope on the right hand and the left. The portion 
which looks towards the Adriatic Sea is called Dalmatia 
and Illyricum, above mentioned, while Pannonia stretches 
away towards tlie north, and has the Danube for its extreme 
boundary. In it are the colonies of ^mona^ and Siscia. 
The following rivers, both known to fame and adapted for 
commerce, flow into the Danube ; the Draus^, which rushes 
from Xoricum with great impetuosity, and the Sa\Tis'', which 
flows with a more gentle -current from the Carnic Alps, there 
being a space between them of 120 miles. The Draus runs 
through the Serretes, the Serrapilli^, the lasi, and the An- 
dizetes ; the Savus through the Colapiani^ and the Breuci ; 
these are the principal peoples. Besides them there are 
the Arivates, the Azali, the Amantini, the Belgites, the 
Catari, the Cornacates, the Eravisci, the Hercuniates^", the 



far from Yienna. Mannert, however, is of opinion that the name ought 
to be written Pelso, and that the modern Balaton or Flatten See is meant. 

^ The mountainous and woody tract in the vicinity of the Lake 
Balaton, on the confines of ancient Noricum and Pannonia. 

2 Now Sarvar on the river Raab, on the confines of Austria and 
Hungary.

* This province corresponded to the eastern part of Austria, St}-ria, 
Carinthia, Carniola, the whole of Hungary between the Danube and 
Saave, Slavonia, and part of Croatia and Bosnia. It was reduced by 
Tiberius, acting under the orders of Augustus. 

* Now Laybach, previously mentioned in c. 22. Sissia has been suc- 
ceeded by the modern Sissek on the Saave. 

^ The modem Draave or Drau. &lt;" Now the Sau or Saave. 

8 According to Hardouin the Serretes and the Serrapilli inhabited 
the modern Carinthia on both sides of the Draave. The sites of the other 
nations here mentioned arc unknov^Ti.

Latovici, the Oseriates, the Varciam, and, in front of Mount 
Claudius, the Scordisci, behind it the Taurisci. In the Sa\Tis 
there is the island of Metubarris^ the greatest of all the 
islands formed by rivers. Besides the above, there are 
these other rivers worthy of mention : — the Colapis^, which 
flows into the Sa\'us near Siscia, where, dividing its channel, 
it forms the island which is called Segestica^ ; and the river 
Bacuntius^, which flows into the Savus at the town of Sir- 
mium, where we find the state of the Sirmienses and the 
Amantini. Forty-five miles thence is Taurunum*, where 
the Savus flows into the Danube ; above which spot the 
Yaldanus'^ and the Urpanus, themselves far from ignoble 
rivers, join that stream. 

CHAP. 29. (26.) — M(ESIA. 

Joining up to Pannonia is the province called Moesia'', which 
runs, with the course of the Danube, as far as the Euxine. 
It commences at the confluence^ previously mentioned. In it 
are the Dardani, the Celegeri, the Triballi, the Timachi, the 
Moesi,theThraciaus,and the Scythians who border on the Eux- 
ine. The more famous among its rivers are the Margis^, which 
rises in the territory of the Dardani, the Pingus, the Tima- 
chus, the (Escus which rises in Mount Bhodope, and, rising 
in Mount Hsemus, the Utus^°, the Asamus, and the Icterus. 

Draave. The nations mentioned here dwelt on the western and eastern 
slopes of this range. 

^ Now known as Zagi'abia, ^ Now the Culpa. 

3 Dion Cassius, B. xix., says that the river Colapis or Colops flowed 
past the walls of the town of Siscia, but that Tiberius Caesar caused a 
trench to be dug round the towni, and so drew the river round it, leading 
it back on the other side into its channel. He calls the island Segetica. 

** Now the Bossut. Sirmium occupied the site of the present Sirmich. 

^ The modern Tzeruinka, according to D'Anville and Brotier. 

^ Now the Walpo and the Sarroiez, according to Hardoiun ; or the 
Bosna and the Verbas, according to Brotier and Mannert. 

^ Corresponding to the present Servia and Bulgaria. 

^ Of the Danube with the Saave or Savus just mentioned, 

^ Now the Morava, which runs through Servia into the Danube. 
The Pingus is probably the Bek, which joms the Danube near G-radistic. 
'J?he Timachus is the modern Timoch, and the (Escus is the Iscar in 
B ulgaria. 

^^ Now called the Yid, the Osma, and the Jantra, rising in the 
Balkan cham. 



Chap. 30.] ACCOTJNT OF COUNTRIES. ETC. 266 

The breadth of Illyrieum^ at its widest part is 325 miles, 
and its length from the ri^'er Arsia to the river Driiiius 
530 ; from the Drinius to the Promontory of Acroceraunia 
Agrippa states to be 175 miles, and he says that the entire 
circuit of the Italian and Illyrian Gulf is 1700 miles. In 
this Gridf, according to the limits which we have drawTi, 
are two seas, the Ionian' in the first part, and the Adiiatic, 
which runs more inland and is called the Upper Sea. 

CHAP. 30. — ISLANDS OF THE IONIAN SEA AND THE ADRIATIC. 

In the Ausoniau Sea there are no islands worthy of 
notice beyond those which we have already mentioned, and 
only a few in the Ionian ; those, for instance, upon the Cala- 
brian coast, opposite Brundusium, by the projection of which 
■ i harbour is formed ; and, over against the Apulian coast, 
Diomedia^, remarkable for the monument of Diomedes, and 
another island called by the same name, but by some Teutria. 

^ Ajasson remarks here that the name of Illyricum was very vaguely 
used by the ancients, and that at diiferent periods, ditterent countries 
were so designated. In Pliny's time that region comprised the country 
between the Arsia and the mouth of the Drilo, bounding it on the side 
of Macedonia. It would thus comprehend a part of modern Carniola, 
with part of Croatia, Bosnia, Dalmatia, and Upper Albania. In later 
times this name was extended to Noricum, Pannonia, Moesia, Dacia, 
Macedonia, Thessalia, Achaia, Epirus, and even the Isle of Crete. 

2 Here meaning that part of the Mediterranean whi-h lies between 
Italy and Greece south of tlie Adriatic. In more ancient times the 
Adi'iatic was included in the Ionian Sea, which was probably so called 
from the Ionian colonies which settled in Cephallenia and the other 
islands on the western coast of Greece. 

3 More properly " Diomedese," being a group of small islands off the 
coast of Apulia now called Isole di Tremiti, about eighteen miles from 
the mouth of the Fortore. Tliey were so called from the fable that here 
the companions of Diomedes were changed into birds. A species of sea- 
fowl (which Pliny mentions in B. x. c. 44) were said to be the descend- 
ants of these Greek sailors, and to show a great partiahty for such 
persons as were of kindred extraction. See Ovid's Metamorphoses, 
B. xiv. 1. 500. The real number of these islands was a matter of dispute 
with the ancients, but it seems that there are but three, and some mere 
rocks. The largest of the group is the island of San Dojiienico, and the 
others are San Nicola and Caprara. The small island of Pianosa, eleven 
miles N.E., is not considered one of the group, but is ncjt improbably 
the Teutria of PHny. San Domenico was the place of bunisluucnt of Julia, 
the licentious daughter of Augustus. 



266 PLI2« r S K^ATUEAL HISTOET. [Book III. 

The coast of lUyricum is clustei«ed with more than 1000 
islands, the sea being of a shoaly nature, and numerous 
creeks and sestuaries running with their narrow channels 
between portions of the land. The more famous are those 
before the mouths of the Timayus, with warm springs^ that 
rise with the tides of the sea, the island of Cissa near the 
territory of the Istri, and the Pullaria" and Absyrtides^, so 
called by the Greeks from the circumstance of Absyrtus, 
the brother of Medea, having been slain there. Some islands 
near them have been called the Electrides'', upon which 
amber, which they call "electrum," was said to be found; 
a most assured instance however of that untruthful- 
ness^ which is generally ascribed to the Glreeks, seeing 
that it has never j^et been ascertained which of the islands 
were meant by them under that name. Opposite to the lader 
is Lissa, and other islands whose names have been already 
mentioned^ Opposite to the Liburni are some islands 
called the Cratese, and no smaller number styled Liburnicse 
and Celadussse''. Opposite to Surium is Bavo, and Brattia^, 

^ Now called the Bagni di Monte Falcone. See B. ii. c. 106. 

2 Now called Cherso and Osero, oiF the lUyrian coast. Ptolemy 
mentions only one, Apsorrus, on which he places a town of that name 
and another called Crepsa. The Pullaria are now called Li Brioni, in 
the Sinus Flanaticus, opposite the city of Pola. ^ gee p. 258. 

^ In B. xxxvu. c. 11, he again mentions this chcumstance, and states 
that some writers have placed them in the Adi-iatic opposite the mouths 
of the Padus. Scymnus of Chios makes mention of them in conjunction 
with the Absyrtides. This confusion probably arose from the fact pre- 
viously noted that the more ancient writers had a confused idea that the 
Ister communicated with the Adriatic, at the same tune mistaking it pro- 
bably for the Vistula, which flows into the Baltic. At the mouth of this 
last-mentioned river, there were Electrides or " amber- bearing " islands. 

^ " Yanitatis." ^ Crexa, Grissa, and Coleutum, in c. 25. 

^ According to Brotier, these are situate between the islands of Zuri 
and Sebenico, and are now called Kasvan, Capri, Smolan, Tihat, Sestre, 
Pai'vich, Zlarin, &amp;c. Some writers however suggest that there were 
no islands called Celadu.ss8e, and that the name in Phny is a corruption of 
Dyscelados inPomponiusMela; which in its turn is supposed to have been 
invented from what was really an epithet of Issa, in a line of Apollonius 
E-hodius, B. iv. 1. 565. 'lo-crd re dvaKcXados, " and inauspicious Issa." 
See Brunck's remarks on the passage.

for the delicate flavour of tbe flesh of its goats and lambs. Issa is now 
called Lissa, and Pharia is the modern Lesina. Baro, now Bua, lies ofi"

and Pharia with a town. At a distance of twenty-five miles 
from Issa is Corc}Ta\ surnamed Melaena, A^ith a tovm. founded 
by the Cnidians ; between which and Illyricum is Melite', 
from which, as we learn from Callimachus, a certain kind 
of little dogs were called Melitaei ; fifteen miles from it we 
find the seven Elaphites^. In the Ionian Sea, at a distance 
of twelve miles from Oricnm, is Sasonis^, notorious from

^ M. Vipsanius Agi'ippa, the distinguished partisan of Augustus, to 
whose niece MarceUa he was married, but he afterwards divorced her 
for Juha, the daughter of Augustus by Scribouia, and the widow of 
Marcellus. He distinguished himself in Gaul, at Actium, and in Hlyria. 
He constructed many public works at Rome, and among them the Pan- 
theon ; he also built the splendid aqueduct at Nismes. He died suddenly 
in liis 51st year. His body was buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus, 
who pronovmced his funeral oration. He wrote memoh-s of his own life. 
PUny often refers to the " Commentarii " of Agrippa, by which are meant, 
it is supposed, certain official Hsts drawn up by him in the measm'ement 
of the Roman world under Augustus. His map of the world is also 
mentioned by Phny in c. 3 of the present Book. ^ ggg g^d of B. ii. 

3 From Servius, Suetonius and Plutarch we learn that Augustus wrote 
Memoirs of his Life, in thirteen books ; from Suetonius, that he com- 
posed a Summary of the Empire (which was probably that referred to in 
the above note on Agrippa) ; and from QuintUian, Aldus GeUius, and PHny, 
B. xviii. c. 38, that he pubUshed Letters written to liis grandson Caius. 

* P. Terentius Varro, surnamed Atacinus, from the Atax, a river of

"Argonautica," his " Cosmograpliia" (probably the same with his "Iter"), 
his " Navales Libri," and his Heroic and Amatory Poems, only a few 
fragments now exist. Of liis life notliing whatever is kno^vn.

^ C. Jiihus Hyginus, a native of Spam, and frecdman of Augustus, by 
whom he was placed at the Palatine Library. He lived upon terms of 
intimacy with Ovid. He wrote works on the sites of the cities of Italy, 
the Nature of the Gods, an accoimt of the Penates, an accovmt of Virgil 
(probably the same as the work called " Commentaries on Virgil"), on the 
PamUies of Trojan descent, on Agriculture, the " Propempticon Oinnse," 
the Lives of Illustrious Men (quoted by John of Salisbiu-y in liis " Poly- 
craticon "), a book of Examples, and a work on the Art of War, also meil-

Poem, in four books, are ascribed to hun, but they are probably pro- 
ductions of a later age.

he anticipated his sentence by opening his veins in a Avarm bath. His

first Roman general who advanced as far as the Danube. Like his son 
of the same name, he was a violent opponent of Julius Caesar. He was 
eloquent as an orator, but ignorant and uncultivated. His orations were 
pubhshed, as also an invective against Caesar, in form of a dialogue, in 
wliich his son was introduced as one of the interlocutors. He died B.C. 53.

3 L. Arruntius, Consul, A.D. 6. Augustus declared in his last iUness 
that he was worthy of the empire. This, with his riches and talents, 
rendered liim an object of suspicion to Tiberius. Being charged as an 
accomphce in the crimes of Albucilla, he put himself to death by opening 
his veins. It appears not to be certain whether it was this person or his 
father who wrote a history of the first Punic war, in which he imitated 
the style of Sallust.

7 In most editions this name appears as L. Ateius Capito, but SiUig 
separates them, and with propriety it would appear, as the name of 
Capito the great legist was not Lucius, Ateius here mentioned was 
probably the person sumamed Praetextatus, and Philologus, a freedman 
of the jurist Ateius Capito. For Sallust the historian he composed an 
Abstract of Roman Histoiy, and for Asinius PoUio he compiled precepts 
on the Art of Writing. His Commentaries were numerous, but a few 
only were surviving in the time of Suetonius. 

^ C. Ateius Capito, one of the most famous of the Roman legists, and 
a zealous partisan of Augustus, who had him elevated to the Consulsliip 
A.D. 5. He was the rival of Labeo, the republican jurist. His legal 
works were very vohuninous, aud extracts from them are to be fomid in 
the Digest. He also wrote a work on the Pontifical Rights and the Law 
of Sacrifices. 

^ A distinguished grammarian of the latter part of the first century 
B.C. He was entrusted by Augustus vkith the education of his grandsons 
Cains and Lucius Caesar. He died at an advanced age in the reign of

^ Also called by Pliny Cornelius Alexander. Smdas states that he 
was a native of Ephesns and a disciple of Crates, and during the war of 
Sylla in Greece was made prisoner and sold as a slave to C. Lentvdus, who 
made him the tutor of his cliildren, and afterwards restored him to free- 
dom. Servius however says that he received the franchise from L. Cor- 
nehus Sylla. He was burnt with his house at Laiu-cntum. Other writers 
say that he was a native of Catiseum in Lesser Phrygia. The surname of 
" Polyhistor" was given to him for his prodigious learning. His greatest 
work seems to have been a historical and geographical account of the 
world, in forty-two books. Other works of his are frequently mentioned 
by Plutarch, Photius, and other vsriters. 

2 The historian of the Peloponnesian war, and the most famous, per- 
haps, of all the ancient writers in prose. 

3 Of Eresus hi Lesbos ; the favom-ite disciple of Aristotle, and desig-

composed more than 200 works on various subjects, of which only a very 
few survive. ■* See end of B. ii. ^ See end of B. ii. 

^ He is frequently mentioned by Cicero, and was famous for his elo- 
quence. Phny informs us in liis 34th book, that from his hatred of the 
Romans he was called the " Roman-hater." It is probable that he was 
the wi'iter of a Periegesis, or geographical work, from which Phny seems 
to quote. 

7 No particulars of tliis author are known. He probably wrote on 
geography. 

^ He is agam mentioned by Pliny in B. iv. c. 13, and B. vi. c. 31, and 
by Solinus, c. xxu. 60. It is supposed that he was the author of a Pe- 
riplus or Cfrcumnavigation of the Earth, mentioned by Pliny B. vii. c. 48 ; 
but notliing frirther is known of him. 

^ Diodorus Siculus was a native of Agyra or Agyrium, and not of 
Syracuse, though he may possibly have resided or studied there. It can- 
not be doubted that he is the person here meant, and Phny refers in his 
preface by name to liis liijSXwOrjicr], " Library," or Universal History. 
A great portion of this miscellaneous but valuable work has perished. 
We have but few particulars of his life ; but he is supposed to have 
written his work after B.C. 8. 

^^ Of Syracuse ; an liistorian probably of the time of Pliilip and Alex- 
ander. He was tlie autlior of a Periplus of Asia, and an accomit of Sicily 
and Sardinia. From his stories in the last he obtained the name of 
" Thaumatographus " or 'S\Titer of wonders." 

^^ Of Calliplianes the Geographer notliing is known. 

^2 Probably Timagenos, the rhetorician of Alexandria. He was taken 
prisoner and brought to Rome, but redeemed from captivity by Eaustus, 
the son of Sylla. He wrote many works, but it is somewhat doubtful 
whotlier the " Periplus," in five Books, was ^^Titten by this Tunagenes. He 
is also supposed to have written a work on the Antiquities of Gaul.

CHAP. 1. (1.) — EPIEUS. 

The third great Gulf of Europe begins at the mountains 
of Acroceraiinia\ and ends at the Hellespont, embracing an 
extent of 2500 miles, exclusive of the sea-line of nineteen 
smaller gulfs. Upon it are Epirus, Acarnania, ^tolia, Phocis, 
Locris, Achaia, Messenia, Laconia, Argolis, Megaris, Attica, 
Bo'otia ; and again, upon the other sea'-^, the same Phocis 
and Locris, Doris, Phthiotis, Thessalia, Magnesia, Macedonia 
and Thracia, All the fabulous lore of Greece, as well as the 
effulgence of her literature, first shone forth upon the banks 
of this Gulf "VVe shall therefore dwell a little the longer 
upon it. 

Epirus^, generally so called, begins at the mountains of 
Acroceraunia. The first people that we meet are the Chaones, 
from whom Chaonia'* receives its name, then the Tliesproti*, 
and then the Autigonenses^. AYe then come to the place 
where Aornos'^ stood, with its exhalations so deadly to the 
feathered race, the Cestrini^, the Perrha;bi^, in whose coun- 

^ Now caUed Monti deUa Chimera, or Mountains of Kliimara. See 
p. 262. 2 '£\yQ JEgean Sea, the present Archipelago. 

2 This country contained, accordmg to Pouqueville, the present San- 
giacs of Janina, Delvino, and Chamouri, with the Yavodilika or Princi- 
paUty of Ai'ta. This name was originally given to the whole of the west of 
Greece, from the Promontory of Acroceraunia to the entrance of the Corin- 
thian Gulf, in contradistinction to Corcyra and the island of Cephallenia. 

^ This district, according to Pouqueville, occupied tlie present Cantons 
of Chimera, lapouria, Arboria, Paracaloma, and Philates, 

^ They occupied the site of the present Paraniytliia, according to Pou- 
queville. 

^ Antigonia was about a mile distant, PouquevUle says, from tlio 
modern town of Tebelen. 

7 From 'A "not," and upvis "a bird." Its site is now unknown. 
There were many places of this name. Avemus or Aomos in Campania 
has been previously mentioned. 

^ The remains of Cestria are stiU to be seen at Palea Yenetia, near 
the town of Fdiates. PouquetiUe calls the place Chamouri. 

^ According to Pouqueville, the modern Zagori stands on the site of 
Perrhaebia. Pindus is sometimes called Grammoi?, but is still known by 
ito ancient name.

try Mount Pindus is situate, the Cassiop8ei\ the Dryopes^, 
the Sellse^, the Hellopes**, the Molossi, iu whose territory is 
the temple of the Dodouaean Jupiter, so famous for its oracle ; 
and Mount Tomarus^, so highly praised by Theopompus, 
with its hundred springs gushing from its foot. 

(2.) Epirus, properly so called, advances towards Mag- 
nesia and Macedonia, having at its back the Dassaretse, 
previously® mentioned, a free nation, and after them the 
Dardani, a savage race. On the left hand, before the Dardani 
are extended the Triballi and the nations of Moesia, while in 
front of them the Medi and the Denselatae join, and next to 
them the Thracians, who stretch away as far as the !5^uxine : 
in such a manner is a rampart raised around the lofty heights 
of Ehodope, and then of Hsemus. 

On the coast of Epirus is the fortress of Chiraapra^, 
situate upon the Acroceraunian range, and below it the 
spring known as the E-oyal Waters^ ; then the towns of 

* Cassiope or Cassope stood near the sea, and near the present village 
of Kamarina. Its extensive ruins are still to be seen. 

2 Their district, according to Pouqueville, was in the present Canton 
of DrynopoHs. 

^ The SelU or SeUce Uved in the vicinity of the temple of Jupiter at 
Dodona, in the modern canton of Souli, according to Pouqueville. 

■^ The country about Dodona is called Hellopia by Hesiod. By some 
the HeUi or Hellopes are considered the same as the SelU. Pouqueville 
tliinks that the HeUopes dwelt in the modern cantons of Janina, Pogo- 
niani, Sarachovitzas, and Com-endas, and that the temple of Jupiter stood 
at the spot now called Proskynisis, near Gardiki, the town of Dodona 
being near Castritza. Leake is of the same opinion as to the site of the 
town ; but, as lias been a svibject of rem.ark, it is the only place of celebrity 
in Greece of wliich the situation is not exactly known. Leake however 
thinks that the temple stood on the peninsula now occupied by the 
citadel of Joanina. 

5 Pouqueville thinks that tliis is the hill to be seen at the modern vii- 
lage of Gardiki. He is also of opiuion that the springs here mentioned 
are those at the modem village of Besdounopoulo. His opinions however 
on these points have not been imphcitly received. 

6 B. iii. c. 26. The Dardani, TribaUi, and Moesi are mentioned in 
c. 29. The locahties of the other tribes here mentioned are not known 
with any exactness. 

' It retains the same name or that of Khimara, and gives its name to 
the Acroceraunian range. It was situate at the foot of the chain, whicii 
begins at this spot. 

^ " Aquae regise." Pouqueville suggests, without good reason, as An- 
eart tliinks, that tliis spring was situate near the modern Drimodez or 
Dermadez.

the colony of Buthrotum^, and the Ambraeian Gulf"*, so 
famed in history ; Avhich, with an inlet only half a mile in 
width, receives a vast body of water from the sea, being 
thirty-seven miles in length, and fifteen in width. The river 
Acheron, which runs through Acherusia, a lake of Thespro- 
tia, flows into it^ after a course of thirty-six miles ; it is con- 
sidered wonderful for its bridge, 1000 feet in length, by a 
people who look upon everything as wonderful that belongs 
to themselves. Upon this Gulf is also situate the town of 
Ambracia. There are also the Aphas and the Arachthus^, 
rivers of the Molossi ; the city of Anactoria^, and the place 
where Pandosia^ stood, 

CHAP. 2. — ACARIS^ANIA. 

The towns of Acarnania^ the ancient name of which was 
Curetis, are Heraclia*", Echinus ^\ and, on the coast, Actium, 

' The place called Palseo-Kistes now stands on its site, and some 
remains of antiquity are to be seen. 2 Now the Calama. 

3 Its ruins are to be seen near the modern Butrinto. It was said to 
have been fovmded by Helenus, the son of Priarei. P'amponius Atticus 
had an estate here. 

^ This corresponds to the present Gulf of Arta,and was especially famous 
for being the scene of the battle of Actium. The city of Ambracia lay to 
the north of it. The present Arta is generally beheved to occupy its site. 

5 Pouqueville has shown that Pliny is in error here, and lie says that 
the Acheron is the modem Mavro Pctamos ; but accorchng to Leake, 
the name of it is Gurla, or the river of Suli. It flows into the Port Fa- 
nari, formerly called Glykys Limen, or Sweet Harbour, from the fresh- 
ness of the water there. The Acherusian Lake is probably the great 
marsh that hes below Kastri. 

® It is now called the Arta, and gives name to the Gulf. 

7 The site of Anactoria or Anactoriiim, like that of its neighbour Ac- 
tium, has been a subject of much dispute ; but it is now pretty generally 
agreed that the former stood on the modem Cape Madonna, and ActiuTU 
on the headland of La Punta. 

* Pouqueville takes the ruins in the vicinity of Turco Palaka, eight 
miles from Margariti, to be those of Pandosia. 

^ This district probably occu])ied the present cantons of Yonitza and 
Xeromeros. It was called Curetis from the Curetes, who are said to have 
come fromiEtoUa and settled in Acarnania after their expulsion byj^itolus 
and his followers. 

'0 The modem Yonitza is supposed to stand on its site.

a colony founded by Augustus, with its famous temple of 
Apollo and the free city of Nicopolis^ Passing out of the 
Ambracian Gulf into the Ionian Sea, we come to the coast 
of Leucadia, with the Promontory of Leucate^ and then the 
Gulf and the peninsula of Leucadia^ which last was formerly 
called ]S'eritis\ By the exertions of the inhabitants it was 
once cut oft' from the mainland, but was again joined to it 
by the vast bodies of sand accumulated through the action 
of the winds. This spot is called Dioryctos^, and is three 
stadia in length : on the peninsula is the town of Leucas, 
formerly called Neritus^ We next come to Alyzia'', Stra- 
tos*, and Argos^, surnamed Amphilochian, cities of the 
Acarnanians : the river Acheloiis^" flows from the heights 
of Pindus, and, after separating Acarnania from ^tolia, is 
fast adding the island of Artemita'^ to the mainland by the 
continual deposits of earth which it brings down its stream. 

1 " The city of Yictory." Founded by Augustus on the spot where he 
had pitched his camp before the battle of Actium. 

2 Now called Capo Ducato or Capo tis Kiras. It is situate at the ex- 
tremity of the island of Leucas, and opposite to CephaUenia, Sappho is 
said to have leapt from this rock on finding her love for Phaon unre- 
quited : the story however is devoid of all historical truth. 

3 Now the island of Santa Maura. It was originally a peninsula, and 
Homer speaks of it as such ; but the Cormtliians cut a canal through the 
isthmus and converted it into an island. After the canal had been choked 
up for some time with sand, the Romans reopened it. It is at present 
dry in some parts. 

4 Probably from its town Nericus, mentioned by Homer. 

5 From the Greek word diopvKTo?, a "foss" or "trench." 

6 It probably had this name from the circumstance of the inhabitants 
of Nericiis being removed thither by the Corinthians imder Cypselus. 
The remains of Leucas, which was ravaged by the Eomans B.C. 197, are 
stiU to be seen. 

7 Its remains are still to be seen in the valley of Kandili, south of 
Vonitza. 

8 PouqueviUe says that very extensive and perfect ruins of this place 
are to be seen near the village of Lepenou. 

9 Tliis famous city was deserted on the foundation of Nicopolis by 
Augustus. The place of its site has been a subject of much dispute, but 
it is considered most probable that Leake has rightly suggested that the 
ruins in the plain of VHkha, at the village of Neokhori, are those of this 
city. ^'^ Now the Aspropotamo. 

i"^ One of the group of the Ecliinades ; small islands off the coast of 
Acarnania, which are mentioned by Phny, in C. 19 of the present Book. 
It is now quite united to the mainland.

Tlie peoples of JEtolia are the Athamaiies\ the Tjmphaei^, 
the Ephyri^, the ^nieiises, the Perrha^bi"*, the Dolopes^, the 
Maraces, and the Atraoes'', in whose territory rises the river 
Atrax, which flows into the Ionian Sea. Calydon^ is a city 
of ^tolia, situate at a distance of seven miles from the sea, 
and near the hanks of the river Evenus*. We tlien come to 
Macynia^, and Molycria, behind which lie Mounts Chalcis^'* 
and Taphiassus. On tlie coast again, there is the promontory 
of Antirrhium'\ oft' which is the mouth of the Corinthian 
Grulf, which flows in and separates jEtolia from the Pelopon- 
nesus, being less^"^ than one mile in width. The promontory 
which faces it on the opposite side is called Ehion^^. The 
towns of ^tolia, however, on the Corinthian Gulf are Nau- 
pactus^"* and Pylene'^ ; and, more inland, Pleuron and Hali- 

^ Pouqueville says that Athamania occupied the locaHties now known 
as Djoumerca and Radovitcli. It properly belonged to Epirus, and Pliny 
makes a mistake in considering it as a part of iEtolia. 

^ According to Pouqueville the ruins of Tymphsea are to be seen near 
the village of Paliouri, four miles from Jauina. 

3 Ephyre, a town of the Agrsei, is also mentioned by Strabo, but no- 
thing whatever is known of it. 

4 The main body of the Perrhsebi were a people of Thessaly. 

* Dolopia, now called Anovlachia,was properly reckoned part of Epirus. 
^ They are probably not the same people as the inhabitants of Atrax iu 

Thessaly, which will be found mentioned in the 15th Chapter of this Book. 
7 The most famous city of -3itoha in its day, and the residence of 
(Eneus, father of Melcager and Tydeus, and gi^andfather of Diomedes. 
The greater part of its inhabitants were removed by Augustus to his new 
city of Nicopohs. Leake supposes its nuns to be those seen by him at 
Kurt- A-ga, to the east of the river Evenus. 

* Now called the Fidaris. 

^ Pouqueville supposes the site of Macynia to have been that of the 
modem Koukio-Castron, and that of Molycria the present Manaloudi. 

^^ Probably the present Varassova ; there was a town called Chalcis, 
or Hypochalcis, at its foot. The present Kaki-Skala was probably tlie 
momitain of Taphiassus. 

•1 Opposite the Promontory of Rhium, at the entrance of the Corin-

cupy the site of Pleuron. 

1 Leake supposes some ruins between Kurt-aga, the site of Chalcedon, 
and the east end of the Lagoon of Missolonghi, to be the remains of 
Hahcyma. 

2 Leake supposes it to be identical with the high mountain now called 
Kelberini. Others again identify it with Grribovo. 

3 Phny erroneously places this movmtaia in Aearnania. It was a range 
of ^toha, now called Zygos.

eitlier from the undi'essed skins worn by them, or from the quantities of 
asphodel that grew in their country ; or else from the vapours thrown 
oif by the mmeral springs in those parts. 

^ PouqueviUe imagines its rviins to be those seen about two leagues 
from the modem Galaxidi. 

^ Lapie marks this in his map as the modern port of lanaklii. 

^0 So called from the ancient town of Crissa, which stood on it. It is 
the same as the modern Grulf of Salona. 

^^ Or Eupahum. Leake supposfs it to have stood in the plain of Ma- 
rathia, opposite the islands of Trazonia, where some ruhis still exist. 

^^ Pausanias makes this town to be the same witli the Homeric Crissa, 
but Strabo distinguishes tlic two places, and liis opmion is now generally 
followed ; Cirrha being thought to have been built at the head of the 
'CrissKan gulf, as the port of Crissa. Its rmns are thought to be those

sea is that of Pagae^, from which point the Isthmus of the 
Peloponnesus projects in the form of a neck. 

CHAP. 5. (4.) THE PELOPONNESUS. 

The Peloponnesus, which was formerly called Apia^ and 
Pelasgia, is a peninsula, inferior in fame to no land upon the 
face of the earth. Situate between the two seas, the JEgaean 
and the Ionian, it is in shape like the leaf of a plane-tree, in 
consequence of the angular indentations made in its shores. 
According to Isidorus, it is 563 miles in circumference ; and 
nearly as much again, allowing for the sea-line on the 
margin of its gulfs. The narrow pass at which it commences 
is know by the name of the Isthmus. At this spot the two 
seas, which we have previously mentioned, running from the 
north and the east, invade the land from opposite sides'*, 
and swallow up its entire breadth, the result being that 
through these inroads in opposite directions of such vast 
bodies of water, the sides of the land are eaten away to such 
an extent, that Hellas^ only holds on to the Peloponnesus 
by the narrow neck, five miles in width, which intervenes. 
The Grulfs thus formed, the one on this side, the other on 
that, are known as the Corinthian^ and the Saronic Gulfs. 
The ports of Lechese^, on the one side, and of Cenchreae on 
the other, form the frontiers of this narrow passage, which 
thus compels to a tedious and perilous circanmavigation 
such vessels as from their magnitude cannot be carried across 
by land on vehicles. Por this reason it is that both King 

^ Helicon is a range of mountains with several summits, the loftiest of 
which is now called Paleovuni. Helicon was a grove of the Muses, and 
the fountain of Aganippe was supposed to impart poetic inspiration to 
those who drank of it. 2 gee p. 288.

5 That part of Greece proper wliich lies to the north of the Isthmus, 

^ Now the Gulfs of Lepanto and Egina. 

7 Lechese was the harbour of Corinth on the Corinthian, and Cenclu'ese 
on the Saronic Gulf. The name of the latter is stOl preserved in the 
modem appellation Kechries, which is given to its ruins. :

Demetrius^ Caesar the Dictator, the prince Caius^, and Do- 
mitius Nero^, have at different times made the attempt to 
cut through this neck by fc^rming a navigable canal ; a pro- 
fane design, as may be clearly seen by the result^ in every 
one of these instances. 

Upon the middle of this intervening neck which we have 
called the Isthmus, stands the colony of Corinth, formerly 
known by the name of Ephyre^, situate upon the brow of a 
hill, at a distance of sixty stadia from the shore of either 
sea. From the heights of its citadel, which is called Acro- 
corinthos, or the " Heights of Corinth," and in which is the 
Fountain of Pirene, it looks down upon the two seas which 
lie in the opposite directions. From Leucas to Patra? upon 
the Corinthian gulf is a distance of eighty-eight miles. The 
colony of Patrae^ is founded upon the most extensive pro- 
montory of the Peloponnesus, facing ^tolia and the river 
Evenus, the Corinthian Gulf being, as we have previously^ 
stated, less than a mile in width at the entrance there, 
though extending in length as far as the isthmus, a distance 
of eighty-five miles. 

^ Demetrius PoHorcetes, king of Macedonia, son of Antigonus, king of 
Asia. 

2 Caius CaligrJa, the Emperor. 

2 The Emperor Nero actually commenced the work, having opened 
the undertaking with great pomp, and cut away a portion of the eartli 
with his own hands. He had advanced four stadia, when the work was 
interrupted by the insurrection of Juhus Yindex in Gaul. 

•* AVe cannot agree with Hardouin that "exitus" here means "death," 
in allusion to the unfortunate end of all those who had made the attempt. 
The opinion of Spanheim seems rather deserving of support (though 
censured by Hardouin), that it merely means " the result" in each case ; 
it being the fact, that in all the instances the contemplated undertaking 
was interrupted by some unforeseen event. Periander and llerodes Atti- 
cus also contemplated the formation of this channel. 

5 It is not known when it exchanged this name for that of Corinth ; being 
called by both names in Homer. Scarcely any remains of it are now 
to be seen. The small town on its site is called Gortho, a corruption of 
its ancient name. The water of the lamed spring of Pirene is now oidy 
used for washing clothes. 

® Now Patras. There are few remains of the ancient city, which was 
one of the twelve cities of Achaia. It was made a Koman colony by 
Augustus.

CHAP. 6. (5.) — ACHAIA. 

The province called Acliaia^ begins at the Isthmus ; from 
the circumstance of its cities being ranged in regular suc- 
cession on its coast, it formerly had the name of ^gialos^ 
The first place there is Lecheae, already mentioned, a port of 
the Corinthians ; next to which is Olyros^, a fortress of the 
people of Pellene'* ; then the former towns of Helice and 
Bura^, and the places in which their inhabitants took refuge 
after their towns had been swallowed up by the sea, Sicyon^ 
namely, ^gira^, ^gium, and Erineos^. In the interior are 
Cleonae and Hysise^ ; then come the port of Panormus^", and 
E/hium already mentioned ; from which promontory, Patrae, 
of which we have previously spoken, is distant five miles ; and 
then the place where Pherae" stood. Of the nine mountains 
of Achaia, Scioessa is the most famous ; there is also the 
fountain of Cymothoe. Beyond Patrae we find the town of 
Olenum^^, the colony of Dyme^^, the places where Bupra-

distinguish it from that in the Peloponnesus, its people were called the 
Phtliiotian Acheei.

of these places may still be seen emerging from the sea.

the Asinaean Grulf, which takes its name from the town of 
Asine", and the Coronean, so called from Corone ; which gulfs 
terminate at the Promontory of Tsenarum^. These are all in 
the country of Messenia, which has eighteen mountains, and 
the river Pamisus'^ also. In the interior are Messene^, Ithome, 
CEchalia, Arene^, Pteleon, Thryon, Dorion^", and Zancle^^ 
all of them known to fame at different periods. The margin 
of this gulf measures eighty miles, the distance across being 
thirty. 

^ This city survived tlirough the middle ages, when it was called 
Arkaclia. In 1525 it was destroyed by the Turks, and whea rebuilt 
resumed nearly its ancient name as Cyparissia, by which it is now called. 
The bay or gulf is called the Grulf of Ai-kadia. 

2 Messenian Pylos probably stood on the site of the modem Erana ; 
Pouqueville says however that it is still called Pilo, and other writers 
place it at Zonchio. It stood on the modern Bay of Navarino. 

2 Its site was at the spot called Palseo Kastro, near the modern town of 
Modon. The site of Messenian Helos, so called £i*om its position in the 
marshes, to eXo?, is now unknown. 

^ Now Capo Gallo. 

^ It stood on the western side of the Messenian Gulf, which from 
it was called the Asinsean Gulf. Grisso, or, according to some, laratcha, 
occupies its site. Ivoroni however is most probably the spot where it 
stood, the inhabitants of ancient Corone having removed to it. PetaUdlii 
stands on the site of Corone. A small portion of the Messenian Gulf 
was probably called the Coronean. 

^ Now Cape Matapan. " Now the Pymatza. 

^ Its ruins, which are extensive, are to be seen in the vicinity of the 
modem village of Mavromati. Ithome was the citadel of Messene, on

but Leake supposes it to liave been situate on the liill called Agliia 
Kyriaki, between that place and Sparta. 

^ Or Pharis. The present Chitries occupies its site.

CHAP. 11. (7.) — ATTICA. 

At the narrow neck of the Isthmus, Hellas begins, by our 
people known as Grsecia. The first state that presents 
itself is Attica, anciently called Acte^. It touches the 
Isthmus in that part of it which is called Megaris, from the 
colony of Megara^, lying on the opposite side to Pagse^". 

These two towns are situate at the spot where the Pelo- 
ponnesus projects to the greatest distance ; being placed, one 
on each side, upon the very shoulders of Hellas as it were. 
The Pagaeans, as well as the people of -Sgosthena", belong 
to the jurisdiction of Megara. On the coast there is the 
port of Schoenos^"^, the towns of Sidus^^ and Cremmyon^^, the

5 Nero abolished the institutions of the Roman province of Achaia, 
which had been assigned to the Roman senate, and governed by a pro- 
consul, granting it its liberty. Vespasian, however, again established 
the provincial government, and compelled the Greeks to pay a yearly 
tribute. ^ Now Vostitza.

here : the ports of Piraeus and Phalerum"* are distant from the 
Isthmus fifty-five miles, being united to Athens, which lies 
in the interior, by a wall'^ five miles in length. Athens is a -free 
city, and needs*^ not a word more from us in its commen- 
dation; of fame it enjoys even more than enough. In 
Attica there are the Eountains of Cephisia', Larine, 
Callirrhoe Enneacrunos^, and the mountains of Bri- 
lessus^, ^Egialeus, Icarius, Hymettus^°, Lycabettus", and 
the place where Ilissus^'-^ stood. At the distance of forty- 
five miles from the Piraeus is the Promontory of Sunium^^. 
There is also the Promontory of Thoricos^^; Potamos'% 

the Istlimus, properly so called, and Megara. Its ruins are tlionght to 
be those seen near the chapel of Saint Theodorus. It -was said to hare 
been the liaunt of the wild boar killed by Theseus. 

^ So called from being tlie scene of the ravages of the robber Scu'on. 
They are now called Kaki Scala. 

2 Famous as the principal seat of the worship of the goddesses Demeter 
and Perse]5hone. Its remains are to be seen at tlie modern Lefsina. 

3 Pera Chora marks its site. It was a member of the Tetrapohs of 
Attica, and Probalinthos another. 

* Ulriclis, the best authority, places the port of Plialerum at tlie east 
corner of tlie gi*eat Plialeric Bay, in the vicinity of Tripirglii, or tlie 
Three Towers. The three harbours of the PiroEus are the present Pha- 
nari, Stratiotiki or Paschalimani, and Drako or Porto Leone. 

5 The Piraeus was united to tlie city by two walls, called the " Long 
WaUs," forty stadia in length. The length cf the Phaleric wall was 
thirty-five stadia. 

^ It is to be regretted that such was his opinion. He could have well 
spared space for a description of it. 

' The city of Cephisia, still called Kivisia, was one of the twelve cities 
of Cecrops. The fountain of transparent water is still to be seen here. 

8 Or the " Nine Springs." It was the only source of good water for 
drinking purposes in Athens. This spring is still called by its ancient 
name. Of Larine nothing seems to be known. 

9 Tliis is thought to have been the ancient name of the mountain 
afterwards kno^^'n as Pentchcus, so famous for its marble, now called 
Mendeh or Pentch.

of the Muses too is pointed out in the grove of Helicon. 
To this same Thebes also belong the forest of Cithseron^'*, 

on the east coast to the north of Thoricus. Its harbour was probably 
the modern Dhaskaho ; and the town is placed by Leake at the rums called 
Paleokastro, to the south of the village of Dardheza.

2 One of the twelve ancient cities of Cecrops, on the eastern coast. 
Its name is supposed to be preserved in those of the villages Vraona and 
Paleo Vraona.

of Nemesis, the goddess of retribution. The present Obrio Castro 
occupies its site. 

■* Memorable for the defeat of the Persians by the Athenians, B.C. 490. 
The site of the ancient town of Marathon is thought not to have been at 
the modern village of Marathon, but a place called Vrana, to the south 
of it. 

^ The eastern part of the Eleusinian plain was thus called, from the 
Demus of Thria. Its exact site is uncertain. 

^ MeUte was a Denius of the tribe Cecropis, of Athens, west of the 
Inner Ceramicus. 

7 Now Oropo, on the eastern frontiers of Boeotia and Attica, near the

a favourite scene of the poetic legends. Paleovuni is the highest summit 
of the Hehconian range. Leake fixes the Grove of the ]\Iuses at the 
present chm'ch of Saint Nicholas, at the foot of Momit Marandali, one 
of the summits of Hehcon. 

^ These fountains or sprmgs are veiy difficult to identify, but Hippo- 
crene, or the " Horse-Spring " (said to have been produced by Pegasus 
striking the ground with his feet), was probably at the present Maka- 
riotissa ; wliile Aganippe is the fountam that flows midway between 
Paleo-panagliia and Pyrgaki. 

2 Tliis place was originally a member of the Boeotian confederacy, but 
joined the Athenians, though it did not become an Attic Demus. Leake 
thuiks that its ruins are those seen at Myupoh. Ross tliinks that it 
stood to the east of Ghyfto-kastro, while other writers are of opinion that 
it stood more to the west, near the modem village of Kundara. 

^ Razed to the ground by the Roman praetor Lucretius, for having 
espoused the cause of king Perseus. Its remains are seen about a mile 
from the village of ]\Iazi, on the road from Thebes to Lebada^a.

the unwillingness of the Peneus to mingle with it. It is now called the 
Elasonitiko or X.eraghi.

its rise in Mount Hsemus^ and forms the boundary of Ma 
cedonia : it is worthy of remark that it first discharges itself 
into seven lakes before it proceeds onward in its course. 

Such is Macedonia, which was once the mistress of the 
world, which once extended^ her career over Asia, Armenia, 
Iberia, Albania, Cappadocia, Syria, Egypt, Taurus, and Cau- 
casus, which reduced the whole of the East under her power, 
and triumphed over the Bactri, the Medes, and the Persians. 
She too it was who proved the conqueror of India, thus 
treading in the footsteps of Eather Liber^ and of Hercules ; 
and this is that same Macedonia, of which our own general 
Paulus ^milius sold to pillage seventy-two^ cities in one day.

Selleta', the PriantcT, the Dolonca?, the Thyni, and the 
Greater CoeletcT, below Mount Hsemus, the Lesser at the 
foot of Ehodope. Between these tribes runs the river He- 
brus. We then come to a town at the foot of Ehodope, 
first called Poneropolis^ afterwards PhilippopolisM'rom the 
name of its founder, and now, from the peculiarity of its 
situation, Trimontium^ To reach the summit of Hsemus 
you have to travel six*^ miles. The sides of it that look m 
the opposite direction and slope towards the Ister are in- 
habited by the Moesi^°, the Getse, the Aorsi, the Gaudae, and 
the Clarire ; below them, are the ArrcTi Sarmatse", also called

the Moriseni and the Sithonii, the forefathers of the poet 
Orpheus^', dwell.

distant from Dyrrhachium 325 miles ; also Scotussa^, the 
city of Topiris, the mouth of the river Mestus^, Mount

2 It is difficult to conceive which place of this name is here alluded to, 
as there seem to have been four places on this coast so called, and all 
mentioned by Phny in the present Book. 

3 Called ^Esyma by Homer ; between the rivers Strymon and Nestus. 
^ Now called Kavallo, on the Strymonic Gulf. The site of Datos 

a ppears to be unknown. 

^ Now called Fihba, or Fehbejik, on a height of Mount Panggeus, on 
the river Grangites, between the Nestus and the Strymon. It was founded 
by Pluhp, on the site of the ancient town of Crenides, in the vicinity of 
the gold mmes. Here Augustus and Antony defeated Brutus and Cassius, 
B.C. 42 ; and here the Apostle Paul first preached the Gospel in Europe, 
A.D..53. See Acts xvi. 12.

that mentioned in the last Chapter.

most important Greek city on the coast of Macedon. It was taken and 
destroyed by Phihp, B.C. 347, and its inhabitants sold as slaves. Mecy-

then come to Mount Serrium^ and Zone-, and then tlie 
place called Doriscus"^, capable of containing ten thoiisand 
men, for it Avas in bodies of ten thousand that Xerxes here 
numbered his army. We then come to the mouth of the 
Hebrus'*, the Port of Steritor, and the free town of ^nos^, 
with the tomb there of Polydorus^, the region formerly of 
the Cicones- 

From Doriscus there is a winding coast as far as Macron 
Tichos^, or the "Long AVall," a distance of 122 miles; 
round Doriscus flows the river Melas, from which the Gulf 
of Melas^ receives its name. The towns are, Cypsela^, 
Bisanthe^", and Macron Tichos, already mentioned, so called 
because a wall extends from that spot between the two 
seas, — that is to say, from the Propontis to the Gulf of 
Melas, thus excluding the Chersonesus", Avhicli projects 
beyond it. 

The other side of Thrace now begins, on the coast ^' 
of the Euxine, where the river Ister discharges itself; and 
it is in this quarter perhaps that Thrace possesses the finest 
cities, Histropolis^^, namely, founded by the Milesians, 

I A promontory opposite the island of Samothrace. 

"■^ A towTi on a promontory of the same name, said to have been fre- 
quented by Orpheus. 

3 The Plain of Doriscus is now called the Plain of Romigik. Parisot 
suggests the true reading here to be 100,000, or, as some MSS. have 
it, 120,000, there being notliing remarkable in a plain containing 10,000 
men. PUny however does not mention it as being remarkable, but 
merely suggests that the method used by Xerxes here for numbering 
his host is worthy of attention. 

^ Now the Maritza. At its mouth it divides into two branches, the 
eastern forming the port of Stentor. * Still called Enos. 

^ A son of Priam and Ilccuba, murdered by Polymnestor, king of the 
Thracian Chersonesus, to obtain his treasiu-es. See the iEneid, B, iii.

barians used to call them Cattuzi, and entertain a belief 
that they were put to flight by cranes. Upon the coast, 
proceeding from Dionysopolis, is Odessus", a city of the 
Milesians, the river Panysus*^, and the town of Tetranaulo- 
chus. Mount Heemus, which, mth its vast chain, over- 
hangs the Euxine, had in former times upon its summit 
the town of AristsBum''. At the present day there are upon 
the coast Mesembria^, and Anchialum^, where Messa for- 
merly stood. The region of Astice formerly had a town 
called Anthium ; at the present day Apollonia^° occupies 
its site. The rivers here are the Panisos, the Eiras, the 
Teams, and the Orosines ; there are also the towns of Thy- 
nias", Halmydessos^^, Develton^^, with its lake, now known 
as Deultum, a colony of veterans, and Phinopolis, near 
which last is the Bosporus^"*. From the mouth of the Ister

Medea here cut to pieces the body of her brother Absyrtus. It is famous 
as the place of Ovid's banishment ; and here he wrote his ' Tristia' and liis

from it to the extremity of the Chersonesus, 126. 

On leadiig the Bosporus we come to the Grulf of Cas-

Haven, and the other the Women's Haven. Next comes 
the promontory of Chrysoceras'^, upon which is the town of 
Byzantium^, a free state, formerly called Lygos, distant from 
Dyrrhachium 711 miles, — so great being the space of land 
that intervenes between tlie Ach'iatic Sea and the Propontis. 
AV^e next come to the rivers Bathynias and Pydaras"*, or 
Athyras, and the towns of Selymbria* and Perinthus^, which 
join the mainland by a neck only 200 feet in width. In the 
interior are Bizya", a citadel of the kings of Thrace, and hated 
by the swallows, in consequence of the sacrilegious crime 
of Tereus*^ ; the district called Csenica^, and the colony of 
Flaviopclis, where formerly stood a town called Cfela. Then, 
at a distance of fifty miles from Bizya, we come to the colony 
of Apros, distant from Philippi 180 miles. Upon the coast 
is the river Erginus^"; here formerly stood the town of 
Ganos^^ ; and Lysimachia^" in the Chersonesus is being now 
gradually deserted.

by no means dissimilar, two cities formerly stood on the sliore, 
one on either side, Pactye on the side of the Propontis, and 
Cardia^ on that of the Grulf of Melas, the latter deriving its 
name from the shape^ which the land assumes. These, how- 
ever, were afterwards united with Lysimachia^, which stands 
at a distance of five miles from Macron Tichos. The Cherso- 
nesus formerly had, on the side of the Propontis, the towns 
of Tiristasis, Crithotes, and Cissa'*, on the banks of the river 
^gos* ; it now has, at a distance of twenty-two^ miles from 
the colony of Apros, Hesistos, which stands opposite to the 
colony of Parium. The Hellespont also, which separates, 
as we have already^ stated, Europe from Asia, by a channel 
seven stadia in width, has four cities facing each other, 
Callipolis'^ and Sestos^ in Europe, and Lampsacus^*' and 
Abydos^^ in Asia. On the Chersonesus, there is the pro- 
montory of Mastusia^^, lying opposite to Sigeum^^ ; upon

treme front of tlie Chersonesus, wMcli is called ^^oliiim, there 
is the city of Elieus. Advancing thence towards the Grulf of 
Melas, we have the port of Coelos\ Panormus, and then 
Cardia, previously mentioned. 

In this manner is the third great Gulf of Europe bounded. 
The mountains of Thrace, besides those already mentioned, 
are Edonus, Grigemoros, Meritus, and Melamphyllos ; the 
rivers are the Bargus and the Syrmus, which fall into the 
Hebrus. The length of Macedonia, Thrace, and the Hel- 
lespont has been already^ mentioned ; some writers, how- 
ever, make it 720 miles, the breadth being 384. 

What may be called a rock rather than an island, lying 
between Tenos and Chios, has given its name to the ^gean 
Sea ; it has the name of jEx^ from its strong resemblance 
to a goat, which is so called in Grreek, and shoots precipitately 
from out of the middle of the sea. Those who are sail- 
ing towards the isle of Andros from Achaia, see this rock on 
the left, boding no good, and warning them of its dangers. 
Part of the ^wan Sea bears the name of Mvrtoan^ beinir 
so called from the small island [of Myrtos] which is seen 
as you sail towards Macedonia from Gersestus , not far from 
Carystus' in Euboea. The Eomans include all these seas 
under two names, — the Macedonian, in those parts where it 
touches the coasts of Macedonia or Thrace, and the Grecian 
where it washes the shores of Greece. The Greeks, how- 
ever, divide the Ionian Sea into the Sicilian and the Cretan 
Seas, after the name of those islands ; and they give the 
name of Icarian to that part which lies between Samos and 
Myconos. The gulfs iKvhich we have already mentioned, 
have given to these seas the rest of their names. Such, 

^ Now called Kilidbalir. Near this place the Spartans were de- 
feated by the Athenians, who erected a trophy near tlie tomb of 
Hecuba.

of Theseus, who threw himself into it; or from JEgfeix, a ciueen of the 
Amazons, who perished there ; or from yl^gffon, a god of the sea ; or

CHAP. 19. (12.) THE ISLANDS WHICH LIE BEEOEE THE 

LANDS ALEEADY MElSTTIOlSrED. 

Lying opposite to Thesprotia, at a distance of twelve 
miles from Buthrotus, and of fifty from Acroceraunia, is the 
island of Corcyra\ with a city of the same name, the citi- 
zens of which are free ; also a town called Cassiope^, and a 
temple dedicated to Jupiter Cassius. This island is ninety- 
seven miles in length, and in Homer has the names of 
Scheria and Phseacia ; while CaUimachus calls it Drepane. 
There are some other islands around it, such as Thoronos'"^, 
lying in the direction of Italy, and the two islands of Paxos"* 
in that of Leucadia, both of them five miles distant from 
Corcyra. Not far'^ from these, and in front of Corcyra, are 
Ericusa, Marathe, Elaphusa, Malthace, Trachie, Pythionia, 
Ptychia, Tarachie, and, off Phalacrum^, a promontory of 
Corcyra, the rock into which (according to the story, which 
arises no doubt from the similarity of appearance) the ship 
of Ulysses was changed. 

Before Leucimna'^ we find the islands of Sybota, and be- 
tween Leucadia and Achaia a great number of islands, among 
which are those called Teleboides^, as also Taphiae ; by the 
natives, those which lie before Leucadia are called by the 
names of Taphias, Oxiae, and Prinoessa^ ; while those that 
are in front of ^Etolia are the Echinades^", consisting of 
^gialia, Cotonis, Thyatira, Greoaris, Dionysia, Cyrnus, 
Chalcis, Piuara, and Mystus. im 

1 Now Corfu. Of its city of Corcyra only a few ruins now exist. 

2 There are still some remains of it near the village called Cassopo. 

3 Now Fano, or Merlere. ^ Now Paxo and Antipaxo. 

5 On the contrary, they he at the other end of the isle of Corcyi'a. 
Some of them are mere rocks, and cannot be distinguished by their ancient 
names. The present names of four are Sametraki, Diaplo, Boaia, and 
the Isle of Ulysses. ^ Now Capo Drasti. 

7 Now Capo Levkimo. The islands are those of Santo Niccolo. 

8 Or Islands of the Teleboans. 

9 These three seem to be those now called Magnisi, Kalamota, and 
Kastus. These lie facmg the promontory of Leucadia, the others opposite 
;E oha. 

^° Opposite Acamania : by the Venetians they were called the Islands of 
Kurtzolari. Some of them are cultivated, others again are mere rocks.

Tn front of these, and lying out at sea, are Cepliallenia^ and 
Zacynthus", botli of them free, Ithaea'"^, Dalicliium^, Same', 
and Crocyle^. Cephanenia, formerly known as ISIeliena'', 
lies at a distance of eleven miles from Paxos, and is ninety- 
three miles in circumference : its city of Same has been 
levelled to the groimd by the Romans ; but it still pos- 
sesses three others^. Between this island and Achaia lies 
the island of Zacynthus, remarkable for its city of the 
same name, and for its singidar fertility. It formerly had 
the name of Hyrie, and lies to the south of Cephallenia, at 
a distance of twenty-five miles ; in it there is the famous 
mountain of Elatus^. This island is thirty-six miles in cir- 
cumference. At a distance of fifteen miles from Zacynthus 
is Ithaca, in which is Moimt Neritus ^'^ ; its circumference 
in all is twenty-five miles. Twelve miles distant from 
this island is Araxus", a promontory of the Peloponnesus. 
Before Ithaca, lying out in the main sea, are Asteris^" and 
Prote ; and before Zacynthus, at a distance of thirty- 
five miles in the direction of the south-east wind, are the 
two Strophades^^, by some known as the Plotse. Before 
Cephallenia lies Letoia^^, before Pylos the three SphagiiB^^, 
and before Messene the (Enussa3^^, as many in number. 

^ Now called CepliaUcnia. 2 Xow Zante. 

3 Now Thiaki, or Cefalogna Piccola — Little Cephallenia. 

^ The general opinion is, that Strabo is right m identifying this island 
with one of the Echinades ; but it seems impossible now to say which 
of them was so called. 

° Sometimes confoimded witli Cephallenia ; but, according to Virgil 
and Mela, as weU as Phny, they were different islands. 

^ Crocylsea was a town of Acarnania, referred to by Homer ; and there 
was a district of Ithaca called Crocyleium. Pliny is probably in error in 
mentioning Crocyle as an island. ' Or the " Black Island ;" 

probably from its thick foUage. ' Pale, Cranii, and Proni. 

9 So called from its fir-trees. It now has the name of Scopo. 

10 Now Monte Stefano. '' See c. 6 of this Book.

called Dyscallio. Though mentioned by Homer, its existence was dis- 
puted by many of the ancient commentators.

Porphyris. It is situate five miles from the promontory of 
Malea^,thus forming a strait very dangerous to navigation. In 
the Grulf of Argolis are Pitynsa^, Irine, and Ephyre ; opposite 
the territory of Hermione^, Tiparenus, Aperopia^, Colonis^, 
and Aristera ; and, opposite that of Troezen, Calauria^, at a

of Crete. 

CHAP. 20. — CEETE. 

Crete itself lies from east to west, the one side facing the 
south, the other the north, and is known to fame by the 
renown of its hundred cities. Dosiades says, that it took 
its name from the nymph Crete, tlie daughter of Hesperides ^ ; 
Anaximander,from a king of the Curetes, Philistides of Mallus 
*#**#. -^yl^ile Crates says that it was at first called Aeria, 
and after that Curetis ; and some have been of opinion 
that it had the name of Macaron"- from the serenity of its 
climate. In breadtli it nowhere exceeds fifty miles, being 
widest about the middle. In length, however, it is full 270 
miles, and 589 in circumference, forming a bend towards 
the Cretan Sea, which takes its name from it. At its 
eastern extremity is the Promontory of Sammonium^, facing 
llhodes, wliile towards tlie west it throws out that of Criu- 
metopon**, in the direction of Cyrene. 

The more remarkable cities of Crete are, Phalasarna, Eta^a*, 
Cisamon'^, Pergamum, Cydonia^, Minoium^, Apteron^, Panto- 
matrium, Amphimalla^", Rhithymna, Panormus, Cytaum, A-

Chaule-burnau. ^ Ilardoidn calls it Chisamo. 

7 The modem Kliania, The quince derived its Latui name, "Malum 
Cydoniiun," from this district, to Avhich it was indigenous. From its 
Latin name it was called melicototie bv the writers of the Elizabellian 
period. ^ Now Minolo, according to llardouin.

its site near the modern Haghius Dheka, the place of the martyrdom of 
the ten Saints, according to tradition, in the Decian persecution. 

3 It has been remarked, that Pliny is mistaken here if he intends to 
enumerate Cnossus among the towns of the interior of Crete. The only 
remains of tliis capital of Crete, situate on the north of the island, are 
those seen at Makro-Teikho, or the " Long Walls," so called fi'om the 
masses of Rom.an brick- work there seen. 

■* Though an inland town, it probably stood in the vicinity of the 
headland or promontory of the same name, which is now called Kavo 
StaTTO. Many of these names are utterly unknown. 

^ One of the most important towns of Crete, on the N.W. slope of 
Mount Ida, about fifty stadia from the port of Astale. Mr. PasUey 
says that some remains probably of tliis place are stiU to be seen on a 
hill near a place called Eletherna, five miles south of the great convent 
of Arkadlii. 

6 The loftiest point of the momitain-range that traverses the island of 
Crete from west to east. Its head is covered with snow. The modern 
name is Psiloriti, looking down on the plain of Mesara. The word Ida 
is supposed to mean a mountain in which mines are worked, and the 
Idaei DactyH of Crete were probably among the fu"st workers in iron and 
bronze. The position of Momit Cadistus, belonging to the range of 
White Mountains, has been fixed by Hoeck at Cape Spadlia, the most 
northerly point of the island. It is thought that Phny and Solinus are 
in error in speaking of Cadistus and Dictynnseus as separate peaks, 
these being, both of them, names of the mountain of which the cape was 
formed; the latter name havmg been given in later times, from the 
worsliip and temple there of Dictynna.

Peloponnesus, are the two isles knoAvn as Corycse, and the 
two called Myla}^ On the north side, having Crete on the 
right, and opposite to Cydonia, is Leuce"', and the two islands 
known as Budrope^. Opposite to Matium lies Dia^ ; opposite 
to the promontory of Itauum^, Onisia and Leuce ; and over 
against Hierapytna, Chrysa and Gaudos^. In the same 
neighbourhood, also, are Ophiussa, Butoa, and Aradus ; and, 
after doubling Criumetopon, we come to the three islands 
known as Musagorus. Before the promontory of Sam- 
monium lie the islands of Phocoe, the Platise, the Sirnides, 
Xaulochos, Armedon, and Zephyre. 

Belonging to Hellas, but still in the ^gean Sea, we have 
the Lichades'', consisting of Scarphia, Coresa, Phocaria, 
and many others which face Attica, but have no towns 
upon them, and are consequently of little note. Opposite 
Eleusis, however, is the lar-famed Salamis^ ; before it, Psytta- 
lia^; and, at a distance of five miles from Sunium, the 
island of Helene^^. At the same distance from this last is 
Ceos'\ wliich some of our countrpnen have called Cea, and 
the Grreeks Hydrussa, an island which has been torn away 
from Euboea. It was formerly 500 stadia in length ; but 
more recently four-fifths of it, in the direction of Boeotia, have

Euboea'* itself has also been rent away from Boeotia; the 
channel of the Euripus, which flows between them, being so 
narrow as to admit of the opposite shores being united by 
a bridge^. At the south, this island is remarkable for its 
two promontories, that of Grersestus^, which looks towards 
Attica, and that of Caphareus^, which faces the Hellespont ; 
on the north it has that of Censeum^. In no part does 
this island extend to a greater breadth than forty miles, 
while it never contracts to less than two. In length it 
runs along the whole coast of Boeotia, extending from 
Attica as far as Thessaly, a distance of 150 miles 9. In 
circumference it measures 365, and is distant from the 
Hellespont, on the side of Caphareus, 225 miles. The cities 
for which it was formerly famous were, Pyrrha, Porthmos, 
Nesos, Cerinthos^*^, Oreum, Dium, ^depsos^\ Ocha, and 
(Echalia; at present it is ennobled by those of Chalcis^^ 

1 There are considerable remains of this town, called by the inhabit- 
ants Stais Palais. 

2 Or Coresia. It was the harbour of luHs, to wliich place we learn 
from Strabo that its inhabitants were transferred. 

3 On the S.W. side of the island. Its ruins are inconsiderable, but 
retain their ancient name. 

* Now called Euboea, as also Egripo, or IN'egropont, — a corruption of 
the former word and " pont," " a bi'idge." 

^ Ilardouin speaks of tliis as existing in liis time, 1670, and being 250 
feet m length. It is supposed to have been fu'st constructed about B.C. 
411, for the pin*pose of uninterrupted communication with Boeotia. 

6 Now Capo Mandili, ^ Now Kavo Doro, or Xylofago. 

8 Now Lithadha, with a mountain 2837 feet above the sea. 

3 These measurements are not exactly correct. The length from north 
to south is about ninety miles ; the extreme breadth across, thu'ty, and 
in one part, not more than four miles. 

^0 Still extant ui the time of Strabo, who speaks of it as an incoii- 
siderable place. 

^^ Its site is now called Lipso. It contained warm baths sacred to 
Ilercules, and used by the Dictator Sylla. They are still to be seen. 

^2 Now Egripo, or Negropont, having given name to the rest of the 
island. The Euripus is here only forty yards across, being crossed by a

(opposite which, on the mainland, is Aulis), Geraestus*, 
Eretria"^, Carystiis^, Oritaniim, and xVrtemisium\ Here are 
also the Fountain of Aretluisa^ the river Lelantus, and the 
warm springs known as Ellopiae ; it is still better known, 
liowever, for the marble of Carystus. This island used 
fonnerly to be called Chalcodontis and Macris", as we learn 
from Dionysius and Ephorus ; according to Aristides, Macra ; 
also, as Callidemus says, Chalcis, because copper was first 
discovered here. Mensechmus says that it was called 
Abantias^, and the poets generally give it the name of 
Asopis. 

CHAP. 22. — THE CTCLADES. 

Beyond Euboea, and out in the Myrtoan^ Sea, are numerous 
other islands ; but those more especially famous are, Glau- 

bridge, partly of stone, partly of wood. The poet Lvcophron and the 
orator Isoeus were natives of this place, and Ai'istotle died here. 

^ Near the promontory of that name, now Capo jMandili. In the 
town there was a famous temple of Poseidon, or Neptune. According 
to Hardouin, the modern name is lastura. 

2 One of the most powerful cities of Euboea. It was destroyed by the 
Persians vuidcr Darius, and a new tovm was built to the soutli of tlie old 
one. New Eretria stood, according to Leake, at the modern Kastri, and 
old Eretria in the neighbourhood of Vathy. The tragic poet Aeha?us, a 
contemporary of ^Esehylus, was born here ; and a school of philosoplay 
was founded at this place by Mencdemus, a disciple of Plato. 

3 Now Karysto, on the south of the island, at the foot of Monnt 
Ocha, upon which are supposed to have been its quarries of marble. 
There are but few remains of the ancient city. The liij;torian Antigonus, 
the comic poet Apollodorus, and the physician Diodes, were natives of 
this place. 

■* Probably on the promontory of the same name. It was off this 
coast that the Greek fleet engaged that of Xerxes, B.C. -180. 

^ There were tame fish kept in this fountain ; and its waters were 
sometimes disturbed by volcanic agency. Leake says that it has now 
totally disappeared. 

s From the fact of its producing copper, and of its being in shape long 
and narrow. 

7 Strabo remarks, that Homer calls its inhabitants Abantea, while he 
gives to the island the name of Euboea. The poets say tliat it took its 
name from the cow (Boi)s) lo, who gave birth to Epaphus on this 
island. 

8 Hardouin remarks here, that Pliny, Strabo, Mela, and Pausanias use 
tlio term " Myrtoan Sea," as meaning that portion of it which lies 
between Crete and Attica, while Ptolemy so calls the sea wliich hes olf 
the coast of Caria.

connesos and the ^gila^ Off the promontory, too, of 
Grersestus are the Cyclades, lying in a circle around Deles, 
from which circumstance^ they derive their name. The 
first of them is the one called Andros^ with a city of the 
same name, distant from Gersestus ten miles, and from Ceos 
thirty-nine. Myrsilus tells us that this island was at first 
called Cauros, and after that Antandros ; Callimachus calls 
it Lasia, and others again Nonagria, Hydrussa, and Epagris. 
It is ninety-three miles in circumference. At a distance ot 
one mile from Andros and of fifteen from Delos, is Tenos"*, 
with a city of the same name ; this island is fifteen miles 
in length. Aristotle says that it was formerly called Hy- 
drussa, from the abundance of water found here, while some 
writers call it Ophiussa^ The other islands are, Myconos^, 
with the mountain of Dimastus^, distant from Delos fifteen^ 
miles ; Siphnus^ formerly called Meropia and Acis, twenty- 
eight miles in circumference ; Seriphus^°, twelve miles in 
circuit ; Prepesinthus^^ ; Cythnos^^ ; and then, by far the most 
famous among the Cyclases, and lying in the very middle 
of them, Delos ^^ itself, so famous for its temple of Apollo, 
and its extensive commerce. This island long floated on the 
waves, and, as tradition says, was the only one that had never 

1 Now called Spitilus, and the group of Micronisia, or " Little Islands," 
according to Hardoviin. ^ From kvkXo?, " a circle." 

3 Now Andi'O. It gives name to one of the comedies of Terence. The 
ruins of tlie ancient city were found by the G-erman traveller Eoss, who 
has published a hymn to Isis, in hexameter verse, which he discovered 
here. It was famous for its wines. 

4 Now Tino. ^ From its aboimding in snakes (o^eis) and scorpions. 

6 Now Mycono, south-east of Tenos and east of Delos. It was famous 
in ancient mythology as one of the places where Hercules was said to 
have defeated the Giants. It was also remarkable for the great proportion 
of bald persons among its inhabitants. 

7 So called from its resemblance to two breasts, fxaZoi. 

8 Wheeler says tliat the distance is but tlu-ee miles ; Toumefort, six. 

^ Once famous for its gold and silver mines, but equally notorious for 
the bad character of its people. It is now called Siphno. 

1" Now Serpho, lying between Cythnos and Siphnus. 

^^ Now Fermina, according to Hardouin. 

^- Between Ceos and Seri})hus. It is now called Thermia. Cydias the 
painter was born here, and it was famous for its cheeses. Its modern 
name is derived fi'om its hot springs, wliich are much frequented.

mere rock, five miles in circumference.

experienced an earthquake, do\Mi to the time of M. Yarro* i 
Mucianus however has informed us, that it has been twice 
so visited. Aristotle states that this island received its 
name from the fact of its having so suddenly made its 
appearance' on emerging from the sea ; Aglaosthenes, how- 
e\"er, gives it the name of Cynthia, and others of Ortygia^, 
Asteria, Lagia, Chlamydia, Cynthus, and, from the circum- 
stance of fire ha^dng been first discovered here, P}Tpile. Its 
circumference is five miles only ; Mount CjTithus^ here 
raises his head. 

Xext to this island is Eliene*, which Anticlides calls by 
the name of Celadussa, and Callidemus, xA-rtemite ; Scyros^, 
which the old writers have stated to be twenty miles in cir- 
cumference, but Mucianus 160 ; Oliaros'' ; and Paros^, with 
a city of the same name, distant from Delos thirty-eight 
miles, and famous for its marble^ ; it was first called Platea, 

^ That is, accorcUng to Yarro, whose statement is ridiculed by Seneca. 
Some of the editors, however, pimctuate this passage dhferently, makmg 
it to mean, " the only island that has never experienced an earthquake. 
IMucianus however has informed us, that do\m to the time of M. Yarro, 
it has been twice so visited." 

2 From its then becoming cijXos:, "plain," or "manifest." It was 
after the fall of Cormth that Delos became so famous for its commei'ce. 
Its bronze was in gi*eat request. 

3 From oprv^, " a quail" ; the legend being, that Latona was changed 
into that bhd by Jupiter, m order to effect her escape thither from tlie anger 
of Juno. Its name of Asteria was derived from dffrpov, "a star," either 
inconsequence of its being devoted to the worship of tlie great luminaiy 
Apollo, or of its being considered by tlie gods the star of the earth. It was 
also called Lagia, from Xayujs, "a hare," that animal abounding there; 
and Cyna?thus, from kuwv, "a dog," it being famous for its hounds. 

■* A bare granite rock, not more tlian 500 feet in height. The island 
is now a mass of ruins ; a great part of its remains liavmg been can'ied 
awav in the middle ages to Yeuice and Constantinople. 

5 Divided by a strait of four stadia in width from Di-los. Js icias con- 
nected the two islands by a bridge. Its name of Ci-ladussa Avas said to 
be derived from the noise of the waves, KeXaco^, and of Artemite, from 
Artemis, or Diana. ^ Now S}-ra ; famous for its wine and com. 

7 Now Antiparos ; famous for its stalactite grotto, wliich is not men- 
tioned by the ancient writers. 

8 Now Paro ; south of Delos and west of Naxos. The ruins of its 
town are still to be seen at the modem Paroikia. The Parian Chronicle, 
inscribed on marble, and containing a clironiele of Grecian history from 
Cecrops, B.C. 1582, to B.C. 26 1, was found here. It is jiresen'ed at Oxford.

and after that, Minois. At a distance of seven miles from 
this last island is Naxos\ with a town of the same name; 
it is eighteen miles distant from Delos. This island was 
formerly called Strongyle^ then Dia, and then Dionysias^, 
in consequence of the fruitfulness of its vineyards ; others 
again have called it the Lesser Sicily, or Callipolis"'. It is 
seventy-five^ miles in circumference — half as large again as 
Paros. 

CHAP. 23. THE SPOHADES. 

The islands thus far are considered as helonging to the 
Cyclades ; the rest that follow are the Sporades^. These 
are, Helene", Phacussa, Nicasia, Schinussa, Pholegandros, 
and, at a distance of thirty-eight miles from Naxos, Icaros^, 
which has given its name to the surrounding sea, and is the 
same number of miles in length^, with two cities, and a 
third now no longer in existence : this island used formerly 
to be called Doliche, Macris, and Ichthyoessa^°. It is situate 
fifty miles to the north-east of Delos, and thirty-five from the 
island of Samos. Between Euboea and Andros, there is an 
arm of the sea ten miles in width, and from Icaros to 
Geraestus is a distance of 112^ miles. 

^ jSTow ISTaxia, famous both in ancient and modem times foi' its re- 
markable fertility. 

2 From arpoyyvXo?, "round," its shape being somewhat inchned to 
cu'cular, though by Eustathius it is compared to the shape of a vine-leaf. 
It is commonly called Dia by the poets. Tournefort says tliat it is distant 
forty miles from Delos. ^ From Ai6vv(tos, or Bacchus, the god of wine. 

'^ Or " Fine City." It took its other name from the fact of its rivalling 
the fertihty of Sicily. 

^ According to Brotier, the Jesuit Babin, on visiting it, found its cir- 
cumference estimated at tliirty-six miles only. 

^ So called from lying scattered at random as it were, cnropd^ "scattered." 

7 Helene is supposed to be the modern Pu^a ; Phacussa, Fecussa ; 
Nicasia, Rachia ; Scliinussa, Scliinusa ; and Pholegandros, Pohcandro. 

8 Now Nikaria, to the west of Samos. According to tradition, it 
derived its name from Icarus, the son of Dsedalus, who was believed to 
have fallen into the sea in its vicinity. 

** Its length is not so gi-eat as is here mentioned by Pliny. Its tovms 
were Drepanum, or Dracanum, Qilnoe, and Isti. 

^^ The first two names are from the Greek, in allusion to its long, 
narrow shape, and the last bears reference to the fact of its shores 
aboimding in fish.

After we pass these, no regular order can "be well observed ; 

tlie rest must therefore be mentioned indiscriminatelj.

tomb there of Homer ; it is twenty-five miles m length, and 

was formerly known by the name of Phoenice ; also Odia, 
Oletandros, and Gyara^, -vs-ith a city of the same name, the 
island being twelve miles in circumference, and distant from 
Andros sixty-two. At a distance of eighty miles from 
Gryara is Syrnos, then C}Tia)thus, Telos"*, noted for its un- 
guents, and by Callimachus called Agathussa, Donusa% 
Patmos^, thii'ty miles in circumference, the Corassia)'^, Le- 

^ 'Now Scyro, east of Euboea, aud one of the Sporades. Here AcliiUes 
was said to have been concealed by his mother Thetis, in -woman's 
attire. • 

2 JS'ow Nio, one of the Sporades, inaccm-ately called by Stephanus one 
of the Cjclades. The modern town is built on the site of the ancient 
one, of which there are some remains. It was said that Homer died 
here, on his voyage from Smyrna to Athens, and that liis mother, 
Clvmene, was a native of this island. In 1773, Van Ki'ienen, a Dutch 
nobleman, asserted that he had discovered the tomb of Homer here, with 
certain inscriptions relative to him ; but they have been generally re- 
garded by the leanied as forgeries. Odia and Oletandi'os seem not to 
have been identified. 

' Now called Gioura, or Jura. It was little better than a barren rock, 
though inhabited ; but so notorious for its poverty, that its mice 
were said to be able to gnaw through u'on. It was used as a place 
of banishment under the Roman emperors, whence the line of Ju- 
venal, i. 73 — 

" Aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris et carcere dignum." 

" Dare some deed deserving of the httle Gyara and the gaol." It is now 
uninhabited, except by a few sheplierds in the summer. 

^ Now Telos, or Piskopi, a small island in the Carpathian Sea, and one 
of the Sporades. It Ues off the coast of Caria. Syrnos appears not to 
have been identified. 

s NearNaxos. Virgil calls it 'viridis,' or 'green,' which Soi-vius ex- 
plains by the colour of its marble. Like Gyara, it was used as a place 
of banishment under the Roman Empire. In C. 22, Phny has mentioned 
Cynfcthus as one of the names of Dclos. 

^ Now Patmo, one of the Sporades, and west of the Pi-omontory of 
Posidium, in Caria. To this place St. John was banit^hed, and liere iic 
wrote the Apocalypse.

Cimolus", or Ecliiuussa ; and Melos^, with a city of that name, 
which island Aristides calls Memblis, Aristotle Zephyria,Cal- 
limachus Mimallis, Heraclides Siphis and Acytos. This last 
is the most circular® in form of all these islands. After this 
comes Machia, then Hypere, formerly Patage, or, as others 
have it, Platage, but now called Amorgos^", Polyajgos", 
Phyle, and Thera^", known as Calliste when it first sprang 
from the waves. Prom this, at a later period, the island of 

1 One of the Sporades, now Lebitlia. 

2 Now Lero. Its inhabitants were of Milesian origin, and of indif- 
ferent character. In its temple of Ai-temis, the sisters of Meleager were 
said to have been changed into guinea-fowls. It w^as opposite the coast 
of Caria. 

3 Now Zinari, N.E, of Amorgos, The artichoke (called Kivapa in 
Greek) is said to have given name to it. 

^ Now Sikino ; between Pholegandros and los. 

* So called, accordhig to Stephanus, from its cultivation of the vine 
and produce of wine, olvos. It was situate between Pholegandros and los. 
It was said to have had the name of Siciuus from a son of Thoas and 
GEnoe. Hieracia seems to be miknoAvii. 

^ StiU known by that name, and lymg between Carpathus and Crete. 
The ruins of the ancient town of Casos are stiU to be seen at the village 
of Polin, It is mentioned by Homer. 

7 Now Kiaioli, one of the Cyclades, between Siplmos and Melos. It 
took its name of Echmussa from the ' Ecliinus,' or Sea-m'chin, of wliich 
various fossil specunens are stiU found on the coast ; but nowhere else in 
these islands, except the opposite coast of Melos. There are considerable 
ruins of its ancient town. 

^ Now MQo, the most westerly of the Cyclades. It is remarkable for 
its extreme fertility. Its town, which, according to most authorities, 
was called Bybhs, was situate on the north of the island. 

'^ Ansart remarks, that our author is mistaken in tliis assertion, for 
not only are many others of these islands more circular in form, but 
even that of Kimolo, wliich stands next to it. 

^^ Now Amorgo, S.E. of Naxos. It was the bu'th-plaee of the Iambic 
poet Simonides. It is noted for its fertility. Under the Roman em- 
perors, it was vised as a place of banishment. 

11 Now Polybos, or Antimelos, an mimhabited island near Melos. 
Phyle seems not to have been identified. 

^'^ Now Santorin, south of the island of los. The tradition was, that 
it was formed from a clod of earth, thrown from the ship Argo. It is 
evidently of volcanic origin, and is covered with pumice-stone. It was 
colonized by Lacedcemonians and Minyans of Lemnos, under the Spartau 
Theras, who gave ids name to the island.

Tlierasia^ was torn a^Yay, and between the two afterwards 
arose Automate, also called Hiera, and Thia, which in our 
own times came into existence in the vicinity of these islands, 
los is distant from Tliera twenty-five miles. 

Next to these follow Lea, Ascania^, Anaphe', Ilippuris, 
and Astypalsea^, a free state. This island is eighty-eight 
miles in circumference, and 125 miles distant from Cadistus, 
in Crete. From Astypalrea, Platea is distant sixty miles, 
and Caminia thirty-eight from this last. AVe then come to 
the islands of Azibintha, Lanise, Tragsea, Pharmacussa, 
Techedia, Chalcia^, Calymna^, in which is the town of Coos, 
Calymna, at a distance of twenty-five miles from which 
is Carpathum'^, which has given its name to the Carpathian 
Sea. The distance thence to Ehodes^, in the direction of the 
south-west wind, is fifty miles. From Carpathum to Casus 
is seven miles, and from Casus to Sammonium, the pro- 
montory of Crete, thirty^. In the Euripus of Euboea, almost* 
at the very mouth of it, are the four islands called Petaliae^'' ; 

^ A small island to the west of Thera, still kno\\Ti by the same name. 

^ In Lapie's map, Ascania is set do%vn as the present Christiana. 

' Now Anaphe, IS'amfi, or Namphio, one of the Sporades. It was 
celebrated for the temple of ApoUo .Egletes, the fomidution of which 
was ascribed to the Ai'gonauts, and of whicli considerable remains stiU 
exist. It aboimds m partridges, as it did also in ancient times. 

■* Now Astropalsea, or Stamphaha. By Strabo it is called one of the 
Sporades, by Stephanas one of the Cyclades. It probably was favoured 
by the Romans for the excellence and importance of its harbours. From 
Hegesander we leaim that it was famous for its hares, and PUny tells us, 
in B. viii. c. 59, that its mussels were (as tliey still are) very celebrated. 

5 None of these islands can be now identified, except perhaps Chalcia, 
also mentioned by Strabo, and now known as Karki. 

^ Now Kalymno, the prmcipal island of the grou^-), by Homer called 
Calydne. According to most of the editions, Winy mentions here 
Calydna andCalymna,makhigthis island, wliich had those two names, into 
two islands. Altliough Pliny here mentions only the tovm of Coos, still, 
in B. V. c. 3n, he speaks of three otliers, Notium, Nisyrus, and Mondc- 
terus. There are still some remains of antiquity to be seen here. 

7 Or Carpathus, now Skarpanto. It gave name to the sea between 
Crete and Rhodes. 

^ It still preserves its ancient name, and presents some interesting 
remains of antiquity.

distant from Lemnos ; it formerly had the name of Aeria, 
or ^Ethria. Abdera\ on the mainland, is distant from 
Thasos twenty-two miles, Athos sixty-two^. The island of 
Samothrace^, a free state, facing the river Hebrus, is the 
same distance from Thasos, being also tliirty-two^ miles 
from Imbros, twenty-two from Lemnos, and thirty-eight' 
from the coast of Thrace ; it is thirty-two miles in circum-

This island is the most inaccessible of them all. Callimachus 
mentions it by its ancient name of Dardania. 

Between the Chersonesus and Samothrace, at a distance 
of about fifteen miles from them both, is the island of 
Halonnesos'', and beyond it Gethone, Lamponia, and Alo- 
peconnesus^, not far from Coelos, aport^ of the Chersonesus, 
besides some others of no importance. The following names

CHAP. 24. — THE HELLESPONT. — THE LAKE MiEOTIS. 

The fourtli great Gulf of Europe begins at the Hellespoi.fc 
and ends at the entrance of the M8eotis\ But in order 
that the several portions of the Euxine and its coasts may 
be the better known, we must briefly embrace the form, 
of it in one general yiew. This vast sea, lying in front of 
Asia, is shut out from Europe by the projection of the shores 
of the Chersonesus, and eifects an entrance into those coun- 
tries by a narrow channel only, of the wddth, as already 
mentioned, of seven stadia, thus separating Europe from 
Asia. The entrance of these Straits is called the Hel- 
lespont ; over it Xerxes, the king of the Persians, con- 
structed a bridge of boats, across which he led his army. 
A narrow channel extends thence a distance of eighty-six 
miles, as far as Priapus^, a city of Asia, at which Alexander 
the Grreat passed over. At this point the sea becomes 
wider, and after some distance again takes the form of a 
narrow strait. The mder part is known as tlie Propontis^, 
the Straits as the Thracian Bosporus'*, being only half-a- 
mile in width, at the place where Darius, the father of 
Xerxes, led his troops across by a bridge. The extremity of 
this is distant from the Hellespont 239 miles. 

"We then come to the vast sea called the Euxine, which 
invades the land as it retreats afar, and the name of which 
was formerly Axenus^ As the shores bend inwards, this 
sea with a vast sweep stretches far away, curving on both 
sides after the manner of a pair of horns, so much so that in 
shape it bears a distinct resemblance to a Scythian bow^. 

^ Now generally known as the Pains Mceotis or Sea of Azof. 

2 The modem Caraboa, according to Brotier, stands on its site. Pri- 
apiis was the tutelary divinity of Lampsacns in this vicinity. 

3 Or " entrance of Pontns " ; now the Sea of Marmora. 

■* " Ox Ford," or " passage of the cow," lo being said to have crossed 
it in that form : now caUed the " Straits of Constantinople." 

5 Said to have been called d^evos or " mhospitable," from its frequent 
storms and the savage state of the people hvmg on its shores. In later 
times, on the principle of Euphemism, or abstaining from words of ill 
omen, its name was changed to evt,eivos, "hospitable." 

^ This was a favourite comparison of the ancients ; the north coast, 
between tlie Thracian Bosporus and the Phasis, formed the bow, and the 
BOiithern shores the strmg. The Scythian bow somewhat resembled in 
form the figui'C S, the capital Sigma of the Greeks. 



Cliap. 24.] ACCOUNT OF C0TJ3TTEIES, ETC. 327 

In the middle of the curve it is joined by the mouth of 
Lake Mseotis, Avhich is called the Cimmerian^ Bosporus, 
and is two miles and a half in width. Between the two 
Bospori, the Thracian and the Cimmerian, there is a distance 
in a straight line, of 500 miles, as Polybius informs us. We 
learn from Yarro and most of the ancient writers, that tlie 
circumference of the Eiixine is altogether 2150 miles ; but 
to this number Cornelius Nepos adds 350 more ; while 
Artemidorus makes it 2919 miles, Agrippa 23G0, and jMu- 
cianus 2425, In a similar manner some writers have fixed 
the length of the European shores of this sea at 1478 miles, 
others again at 1172. M. Yarro gives the measurement as 
follows : — from the mouth of the Euxine to Apollonia 187 
miles, and to Callatis the same distance ; thence to the 
mouth of the Ister 125 miles ; to the Borysthenes 250 ; to 
Chersonesus-, a town of the Heracleota?, 325 ; to Pantica- 
pseum^, by some called Bosporus, at the very extremity of 
the shores of Europe, 212 miles : the whole of whieli added 
together, makes 1337^ miles. Agrippa makes the distance 
from Byzantium to the river Ister 560 miles, and from 
thence to Panticapseum, 635. 

Lake Maeotis, which receives the river Tanais as it flows 
from the Biphaean Mountains^ and forms the extreme boun- 
dary between Europe and Asia, is said to be 1406 miles in 
circumference ; which however some writers state at only 
1125. From the entrance of this lake to the mouth of tlie 
Tanais in a straight line is, it is generally agreed, a distance 
of 375 miles. 

The inhabitants of the coasts of this fourth great Gulf of 

' Now the Straits of Kaffa or Enikale. 

2 Tliis town lay about the middloot'the Tauric Cliorsoncsus or Crimea, 
and was situate on a small peninsula, ealled the Smaller Chersonesus, to 
distinguish it from the larger one, of wliich it formed a part. It was 
founded by the inhabitants of the Pontic Ilcraclea, or Ileracleium, the 
site of which is unkno^\'Tl. See note ^ to p. 333. 

3 Now Kertsch, in tlic Crimea. It derived its name fi-om llic river 
Panticapes ; and was founded by llie ^lilesians about B.C. 5 tl. It was 
the residence of the Greek kings of Bosporus, and lience it was some- 
times so called. ■* " Tliirty-six" properly.

western branch of the Urahan chain, but on slightly elevated ground in 
the centre of European Russia. 



328 plint's natural HISTOET. [Book ly. 

Europe, as far as Istropolis, have been already^ mentioned in 
our account of Thrace. Passing beyond that spot we come 
to the mouths of the Ister. This river rises in Grermany in 
the heights of Mount Abnoba^, opposite to Eauricum^, a 
to^\Ti of Graul, and flows for a course of many miles beyond 
the Alj^s and through nations innumerable, under the name 
of the Danube. Adding immensely to the volume of its 
waters, at the spot where it first enters Illyricum, it assumes 
the name of Ister, and, after receiving sixty rivers, nearly 
one half of which are navigable, rolls into the Euxine by 
six** vast channels. The first of these is the mouth of 
Pence ^, close to which is the island of Pence itself, from 
which the neighboui'ing channel takes its name ; this mouth 
is swallowed up in a great swamp nineteen miles in length. 
Prom the same channel too, above Istropolis, a lake^ takes 
its rise, sixt)' -three miles in circuit ; its name is Halmyris. 
The second mouth is called Naracu- Stoma'' ; the third, which 
is near the island of Sarmatica, is called Calon-Stoma^ ; the 
fourth is known as Pseudo-Stomon^, with its island 
called Conopon-Diabasis^" ; after which come the Boreon- 

1 Chap. 18 of the present Book. Istropolis is supposed to be the 
present I.stere, though some would make it to have stood on the site of 
the present Kostendsje, and Bi'otier identifies it witli Kara-Kerman. 

2 Now called the Schwarzwald or Black Forest. The Danube or Ister 
rises on the eastern side at the spot called Donauescloingen. 

2 So called from the Raurici, a powerful people of GaUia Belgica, who 
possessed several tov^Tis, of which the most important were Augusta, now 
Augst, and Basiha, now Bale. 

'* Only tlu'ee of these are now considered of importance, as being the 
mam branches of the river. It is looked upon as hnpossible by modern 
geographers to identify the accounts given by the ancients vnth. the 
present channels, by name, as the Danube has undergone in lapse of time, 
very considerable changes at its mouth. Strabo mentions seven mouths, 
three being lesser ones. 

5 So called, as stated by Pliny, from the island of Peuce, now Piczina. 
Pence appears to have been the most southerly of the mouths. 

^ Now called Kara-Sou, accorduig to Brotier. Also called Rassefu 
in the maps. 

7 Now called HazraH Bogasi, according to Brotier. It is called by 
Ptolemy the Narakian Mouth, 

* Or the " Beautiful Mouth." Now Susie Bogasi, according to Brotier. 

^ Or the "False Mouth" : now the Sulina Bogasi, the principal mouth 
of the Danube, so maltreated by its Russian guardians. 

^^ Or the " Passage of the Gnats," so called from being the resort of

Stoma^ and the Psilon-Stoma^. These mouths are each of 
them so considerable, that for a distance of forty miles, it is 
said, the saltness of the sea is quite overpowered, and the 
water found to be fresh. 



CHAP, 25. DACIA, SAEMATIA. 

On setting out from this spot, all the nations met 
Avith are iScytliian in general, though various races have 
occupied the adjacent shores ; at one spot the Getse'*, by the 
Eomans called Daci ; at another the Sarmatse, by the Greeks 
called Sauromatae, and the Hamaxobii^ or Aorsi, a branch 
of them ; tlien again the base-born Scythians and descend- 
ants of slaves, or else the Troglodytae^ ; and then, after 
them, the Alani^ and the Khoxalani, The higher^ parts 
again, between the Danube and the Hercynian Forest^, as 
far as the winter quarters of Pannonia at Carnuntum^, and 
the borders of the Germans, are occupied by the Sarmatian 
lazyges^", who inhabit the level .country and the plains, 

swarms of mosqvdtoes, -which were said at a certain tmie of the year to 
migrate to the Palus Ma^otis. AccortUng to Bi'otier the present name 
of tills island is Ilan Adasi, or Serpent Island. 

^ The " Xorthera Mouth " : near the town of Kiha. 

2 Or the " Narrow Mouth." 

3 Though Strabo distinguishes the Getce from the Daci, most of the 
ancient writers, with Phny, speak of them as identical. It is not known, 
however, why the Getse in later times assumed the name of Daci. 

* " Dwellers in waggons." These were a Sarmatian tribe who wan- 
dered with their waggons along the banks of the Volga. The chief seats 
of the Aorsi, who seem in reality to have been a distinct people from the 
Ilamaxobii, was in the country between the Tanais, the Euxine, the 
Caspian, and the Caucasus. 

5 " Dwellers in Caves." Tliis name appears to have been given to 
various savage races in different parts of tlie world. 

^ There were races of the Alani in Asia on the Caucasus, and in Eu- 
rope on the Ma'otis and the Euxine ; but their precise geograpliical 
position is not clearly ascertained. 

7 The present Transylvania and Hungary. 

8 The name given in the age of Pliny to the range of mountains ex- 
tending around Bohemia, and through Moravia into Hungary. 

' Its ruins are still to be seen on the south bank of tlie Danube near 
Haimburg, between Deutsch-Altenburg and Pctronell. The Roman Ueet 
of tlie Danube, with the 11th legion, was originally estabhshed there. 

^^ In Pliny's time this migratory tribe seems to have removed to the

while the Daci, whom they have driven as far as the river 
Pathissus\ inhabit the mountain and forest ranges. On 
leaving the river Mariis", whether it is that or the Duria^, 
that separates them from the Suevi and the kingdom of 
Vannius^, the Basternse, and, after them, other tribes of 
the Germans occupy the opposite sides^. Agrippa considers 
the whole of tliis region, from the Ister to the ocean, to be 
2100 miles in length, and 4400 miles in breadth to the river 
Vistula in the deserts^ of Sarmatia. The name " Scythian" 
has extended, in every direction, even to the Sarmatse and the 
Germans ; but this ancient appellation is now only given to 
those who dwell beyond those nations, and live unknown to 
nearly all the rest of the world. 

CHAP. 26. — SCTTHIA. 

Leaving the Ister, we come to the to^Tis of Cremniscos'', 
^polium, the mountains of Macrocremnus, and the famous 
river Tyra^, which gives name to a town on the spot where 
Ophiusa is said formerly to have stood. The Tyragetse 
inhabit a large island^ situate in this river, which is distant 

plains between tlie Lower Theiss and the mountains of Transylvania, 
from wliich places they had expelled the Dacians. 

^ The Lower Theiss. ^ Now the river Mark, Maros, or Morava. 

3 The name of the two streams now known as the Dora Baltea and 
Dora Riparia, both of which fall into the Po. Tliis passage appears to 
be in a mutilated state. 

■* A cliief of the Quadi ; who,'as we learn from Tacitus, was made king 
of the Suevi by Germanicus, a.d. 19. Being afterwards expeUed by his 
nephews Vangio and Sido, he received from the emperor Claudius a 
settlement in Pannonia. Tacitus gives the name of Suevia to the whole 
of the east of Germany from the Danube to the Baltic. 

^ Accorduig to Hardouin, Phny here speaks of the other side of the 
mountainous district called Higher Hungary, facing the Danube and 
extending from the river Theiss to the Morava, 

^ Tliis, according to SiUig, is the real meaning of a desertis here, the 
distance being mej\sured from the Danube, and not between the Vistula 
and the wUds of Sarmatia. The reading " four thousand" is probably 
corrupt, but it seems more Hkely than that of 404 miles, adopted by 
Littre, in his French translation. 

"^ Placed by Forbiger near Lake Burmasaka, or near Islama. 

^ The Dniester. The mountains of Macrocremnus, or the "Great 
Heights," seem not to have bt&gt;en identified. 

^ According to Hardouin, the modern name of this island is Tandra.

from Pseudostomos, a mouth of the Ister, so called, 130 
miles. We then come to the Axiacae, who take their name 
from the river Axiaces\ and heyond them, the Crobyzi, the 
river Ehodes", the Sagariau Guli'^, and the port of Ordesos^. 
At a distance of 120 miles from the Tyra is the river Bory- 
sthenes^ Avith a lake and a people of similar name, as also 
a towii*^ in tlie interior, at a distance of fifteen miles from the 
sea, the ancient names of which were Olbiopolis and Mile- 
topolis. Again, on tlie shore is the port of the Acha)i, and 
the island of Achilles'', famous for the tomb there of that 
hero, and, at a distance of 125 miles from it, a peninsula 
which stretches forth in the shape of a sword, in an oblique 
direction, and is called, from having been his place of exercise, 
Dromos Achilleos^ : the length of this, according to Agrippa, 
is eighty miles. The Taurian Scythians and the ISiraci* 
occupy all this tract of country. 

At this spot begins a well-wooded district^", which has 

^ Now called the Tehgul, east of the Tyra or Dniester. 

* Now called Sasik Beregen, according to Brotier. 

3 The modern Gulf of Berezen, according to Brotier. 

•* Probably the modern Okzakow. , 

5 The modern Dnieper. It also retains its ancient name of Borrsthcnes. 

" We learn from Strabo that the name of this town was Olbia, and 
that from being founded by the Milesians, it received the name of Mile- 
topoHs. According to Brotier, the modern Zapurooski occupies its site, 
between the mouths of the river Buzuluk. 

7 This was adjacent to the strip of land called " Dromos AchUleos," or 
the 'race-course of Achilles.' It is identified by geographers with the 
httle island of Zmievoi or Oulan Adassi, the ' Serpents Island.' It was 
said that it was to this spot that Thetis transported tlie body of Achilles. 
By some it was made the abode of the shades of the blest, where Achilles 
and other heroes of fable were the judges of tlie dead. 

* A narrow strip of land X.W. of the Crimea and south of the mouth 
of the Dnieper, running nearly due west and east. It is now divided 
into two parts called Kosa Tendra and Kosa Djarilgatch. Aeliilles was 
said to have instituted games here. 

^ According to Ilardouin, the Siraci occupied a portion of the present 
Podoha and Ukraine, and the Tauri the modern Bessarabia. 

^•^ According to Herodotus, tliis region, called Ilylffa, lay to the east of 
the Borysthenes. It seems uncertain whether there are now any traces 
of this ancient woodland ; some of the old maps however give the name 
of the " Black Forest " to this district. From the statements of modem 
travellers, the woody country dues not commence till the river Don has 
been reaclied. The district of llyla-a has been identified by geographers 
■with the great pkin of Juiiboylouk in the steppe of the iSogai.

given to tlie sea tliat waslies its banks the name of the 
Hylsean Sea; its inhabitants are called Enoechadlfce\ Be- 
yond them is the river Panticapes"^, which separates the 
JSFomades^ and the Georgi. and after it the Acesinus^. Some 
authors say that the Panticapes flows into the Boi^ysthenes 
below Olbia^. Others, who are more correct, say that it is 
the Hypanis^ : so great is the mistake made by those who 
have placed if in Asia. 

The sea runs in here and forms a large gulf ^, until there 
is only an intervening space ^ of five miles between it and the 
Lake Mseotis, its margin forming the sea-line of extensive 
tracts of land, and numerous nations ; it is known as the Gulf 
of Carcinites. Here we find the river Pacyris^", the towns of 
Navarum and Carcine^\ and behind it Lake Buges^^, which 

* For Enoechadlse, Hardouin suggests that we should read Inde St/lcBi^ 
"hence the mhabitants are called by the name of Hylsei." 

2 The Panticapes is usually identified with the modern Somara, but 
perhaps withoiit suiBcient grounds. It is more probably the Kouskawoda. 

2 The Nomades or wandering, from the Georgi or agricultural Scy- 
thians-. 

^ The Acesinus does not appear to have been identified by modern 
geographers. ° Above called Olbiopohs or Miletopohs. 

^ The Bog or Boug. Flowmg parallel with the Borysthenes or 
Dnieper, it cUsLarged itself into the Euxine at the town of Olbia, at no 
great distance from the mouth of the Borysthenes. 

7 Probably meaning the mouth or point at which the river discharges 
itself into the sea. 

^ The modern Grulf of Negropoli or Perekop, on the west side of the 
Chersonesus Taurica or Crimea. 

3 Forming the present isthmus of Perekop, which divides the Sea of 
Perekop from the Sea of Azof. 

^^ Called by Herodotus Hypacyris, and by later writers Carcinites. It 
is generally supposed to be the same as the small stream now known as 
the Kalantchak. 

^^ Hardouin says that the city of Carcine has still retained its name, 
but changed its site. More modern geographers however are of opinion 
that nothing can be determined with certainty as to its site. Of the site 
also of Navarum nothing seems to be known. 

^2 Or Buces or Byce. This is reaUy a gulf, almost enclosed, at the end 
of the Sea of Azof. Strabo gives a more full description of it imder the 
name of the Sapra Zdmne, " the Putrid Lake," by wlaieh name it is still 
called, in Russian, SibacJie or Sivache More. It is a vast lagoon, covered 
with water when an east A\Tnd blows the water of the Sea of Azof into it, 
but at other times a tract of shme and mud, sending forth pestilential 
vapours.

discliarges itself by a cliannel into tlie sea. This Biiges is 
separated by a ridge of rocks ^ from Coretus, a gulf iu the 
Lake M^eotis ; it receives the rivers Buges'^, Gerriis^, and 
Hvj^acaris^ wliich approach it from regions that lie in 
various directions. For the Gerrus separates the Basilidse 
from the Xomades, the Ilypacaris flows through the Xo- 
mades and the Hyla}i, by an artificial channel into Lake 
Buges, and by its natiu^al one into the Gulf of Coretus : 
this region bears the name of Scythia Sindice. 

At the river Carcinites, Scythia Taurica^ begins, which 
was once covered by the sea, where we now see level 
plains extended on every side : beyond this the land rises into 
mountains of great elevation. The peoples here are thirty 
in nimiber, of wliich twenty-three dwell in the interior, six 
of the cities being inhabited by the Orgocyni, the Chara- 
ceni^, the Lagyrani, the Tractari, the Arsilachitae, and the 
Caliordi. The Scythotam^i possess the range of moimtains : 
on the west they are boimded by the Chersonesus, and on 
the east by the Scythian Satarchse''. On the sliore, after 
we leave Carcinites, we find the folloAving towns ; Ta- 
phrae^, situate on the very isthmus of the peninsula, and 
then ITeraclea Chersonesus^, to which its freedom has been 
granted'" by the Eomans. This place was formerly called 

^ It is rather a ridge of sand, that almost separates it from the waters 
of the gulf. 

2 This river has not been identified by modem geographers. 

3 According to Herodotus the Gerrhus or GeiTus fell into the Hypa- 
caris ; whicli must be understood to be, not the Kalantchak, but the 
Outlouk. It is probably now represented by the Moloschnijawoda, 
which forms a shallow lake or marsh at its mouth. 

^ It is most probable that the Pacyris, mentioned above, the Hypa- 
caris, and the Careuiites, were various names for the same river, gene- 
rally supposed, as stated above, to be the small stream of Kalantchak. 

* Now the Crimea. 

^ It does not appear that the site of any of these cities has been iden- 
tified. Cliarax was a general name for a fortified towni. 

7 Mentioned again by Pliny in B.vi. c. 7. Sohnus says that in order 
to repel avarice, the Satarclux' prohibited the use of gold and silver.

Megarice, being the most polished city throughout all these 
regions, in consequence of its strict preservation of Grecian 
manners and customs. A wall, five miles in length, sur- 
rounds it. Next to this comes the Promontory of Par- 
thenium\ the city of the Tauri, Placia, the port of the Sym- 
bolic, and the Promontory of Criumetopon^, opposite to 
Carambis^, a promontory of Asia, which runs out in the 
middle of the Euxine, leaving an intervening space between 
them of 170 miles, which circumstance it is in especial that 
gives to this sea the form of a Scythian bow. After leaving 
this headland we come to a great number of harbours and 
lakes of the Tauri'. The town of Theodosia*^ is distant 
from Criumetopon 125 miles, and from Chersonesus 165. 
Beyond it there were, in former times, the towns of CytsB, 
Zephyrium, Acras, Nymphseum, and Dia. Panticapaeum', a 
city of the Milesians, by far the strongest of them all, is 
still in existence ; it lies at the entrance of the Bosporus, 
and is distant from Theodosia eighty-seven miles and a half, 
and from the town of Cimmerium, which lies on the other 
side of the Strait, as we have previously^ stated, two miles 
and a half. Such is the width here of the cliannel which 
separates Asia from Europe, and which too, from being 
generally quite frozen over, allows of a passage on foot. 

^ The modern Felenk-burun. So called from the Parthenos or Yirgia 
Diana or Artemis, whose temple stood on its heights, in which human 
sacrifices were offered to the goddess. 

2 Supposed to be the same as the now-famed port of Balaklava. 

3 The modern Aia-burun, the great southern headland of the Crimea. 
According to Plutarcli, it was called by the natives Brixaba, which, 
like the name Criumetopon, meant the " Ram's Head." 

* Now Kerempi, a promontory of Paphlagonia in Asia Minor. Strabo 
considers this promontory and that of Criumetopon as dividing the 
Euxine into two seas. 

^ According to Strabo, the sca-hne of the Tauric Chersonesus, after 
leavmg the port of the Symboh, extended 125 miles, as far as Theodosia. 
Pliny would here seem to make it rather greater. 

^ The modern Kaffa occupies its site. The sites of many of the places 
here mentioned appear not to be known at the present day. 

7 The modern Kertsch, situate on a hill at the very mouth of the 
Cimmei'ian Bosporus, or Straits of Enikale or Kaffa, opposite the town 
of Phanagoria in Asia. 

^ In C. 21 of the present Book. CLxrk identifies the town of Cim- 
merium with the modem Temruk, Forbiger witli Eskiki'imm. It is 
again mentioned in B. vi. c. 2.

The widtli of the Cimmerian Bosporus^ is twelve miles and 
a half: it contains the towns of Hermisium'^, Myrmecium, 
and, in the interior^ of it, the island of Alopece. From the 
spot called Taphra^"*, at the extremity of the isthmus, to the 
mouth of the Bosporus, along the line of the Lake Mseotis, 
is a distance of 260 miles. 

Leaving Taphrae, and going along the mainland, we find 
in the interior the Auchetae^, in whose country the Hypanis 
has its rise, as also the jN^euroe, in whose district the Bory- 
sthenes has its source, theGreloni^,theThyssagetae,theBudini, 
the Basilida?, and the Agathyrsi''^ with their azure-coloured 
hair. Above them are the Nomades, and then a nation of 
Anthropophagi or cannibals. On lea^ang Lake Buges, above 
the Lake Mjcotis we come to the Sauromata? and the Esse- 
dones'. Along the coast, as far as the river Tanais^, are 

^ He alludes here, not to the Strait so called, but to the Peninsula 
bordering upon it, upon wliich the modern town of Kertscli is situate, 
and which projects £i*om the larger Peninsula of the Crimea, as a sort of 
excrescence on its eastern side. 

2 Probably Heniies or Mercury was its tutelar divinity : its site 
appears to be unknown. 

3 Probably meaning the Straits or passage connecting the Lake Mseotis 
with the Euxine. The fertile district of the Cimmerian Bosporus was 
at one time the granary of Greece, especially Athens, wliich imported 
thence annually 400,000 medimni of com. 

^ A town so called on the Isthmus of Perckop, from a Td&lt;ppos or 
trench, which was cut across the isthmus at this point. 

^ Lomonossov, in his History of Russia, says that these people were 
the same as the Sclaroni : but that one meaning of the name 'Slavane' 
being " a boaster," the Greeks gave them tlie corresponding appellation 
of Auchetoe, fi-om the word avxt), wliich signifies "boasting." 

6 Of the Geloni, called by Virgil "picti," or "painted," nothing cer- 
tain seems to be known : they are associated by Herodotus with the 
Eudini, supposed to belong to the Slavic family by Scbafarik. In B. iv. 
c. 108, 109, of his History, Herodotus gives a very particular account of 
theBudini, who had a city built entirely of wood, the name of which was

come to the Eiphsean^ moimtams, and the region known by 
the name of Pterophoros^, because of the perpetual fall of 
snow there, the flakes of which resemble feathers ; a part of 
the world which has been condemned by the decree of 
nature to lie immersed in thick darkness ; suited for nothing 
but the generation of cold, and to be the asylum of the 
chilling blasts of the northern winds. 

Behind these moiuitains, and beyond the region of the 
northern winds, there dwells, if we choose to believe it, a 
happy race, known as the Hyperborei^, a race that lives to an 
extreme old age, and which has been the subject of many mar- 
vellous stories^. At this spot are supposed to be the hinges 
upon which the world revolves, and the extreme limits of the 
revolutions of the stars. Here we find light for six months 
together, given by the sun in one continuous day, who does 
not, however, as some ignorant persons have asserted, conceal 
himself from the vernal equinox^ to autumn. On the contrary, 
to these people there is but one rising of the sun for the year, 
and that at the summer solstice, and but one setting, at the 
wdnter solstice. This region, warmed by the rays of the 
sun, is of a most delightful temperature, and exempt from

lian chain.

3 This legendary race was said to dwell in the regions beyond Boreas, 
or the northern wind, which issued from the Eiphsean mountains, the 
name of which was derived from pnrai or " hrn'rictines " issuing from 
a cavern, and which these heights warded off from the Hyperboreans and 
sent to more southern nations. Hence they never felt the northern 
blasts, and enjoyed a hfe of supreme happiness and undistvirbed repose. 
" Here," says Hu.mboldt, " are the first views of a natural science which 
explains the distribution of heat and the difference of chmates by local 
causes — by the direction of the winds — the proximity of the sun, and the 
action of a moist or sahne principle." — Asie Cent rale, vol. i. 

^ Pindar says, in the " Pytliia," x. 56, " The Muse is no stranger to 
their manners. The dances of ghls and the sweet melody of the lyre 
and pipe resound on every side, and wreathing their locks with the 
glistening bay, they feast joyously. For this sacred race there is no doom 
of sickness or of disease ; but they hve apart from toil and battles, undis- 
tm'bed by the exacting Nemesis."

every noxious blast. The abodes of the natives are tbe 
woods and groves ; the gods receive their worship singly 
and in groups, while all discord and every kind of sick- 
ness are things utterly unknown. Death comes upon them 
only when satiated with life ; after a career of feasting, 
in an old age sated with every luxiu'y, they leap from a 
certain rock there into the sea ; and this they deem the 
most desirable mode of ending existence. Some writers have 
placed these people, not in Europe, but at the very verge of 
the shores of Asia, because we find there a people called the 
Attacori\ who greatly resemble them and occupy a very 
similar locality. Other writers again have placed them mid- 
way between the two suns, at the spot where it sets to the 
Antipodes and rises to us ; a thing however that cannot 
possibly be, in consequence of the vast tract of sea which 
there intervenes. Those writers who place them nowhere" 
but under a day which lasts for six months, state that in the 
morning they sow, at mid-day they reap, at sunset they 
gather in the fruits of the trees, and during the night conceal 
themselves in caves. Nor are we at liberty to entertain any 
doubts as to the existence of this race ; so many authors^ 
are there who assert that they were in the habit of sending 
their first-fruits to Delos to present them to Apollo, whom 
in especial they worship. Yirgins used to carry them, who 
for many years were held in high veneration, and received 
the rites of hospitality from the nations that lay on the 
route ; until at last, in consequence of repeated "violations 
of good faith, the H}'3)erboreans came to the determination 
to deposit these offerings upon the frontiers of the people 
who adjoined them, and they in their turn were to convey 

his position, and that Pliny is incorrect in his assertion. The same 
commentator tliinks that Pliny can have hardly uitended to censure Mela, 
to whose learning he liad been so much indebted for his geographical 
information, by applying to him the epithet "imperitus," 'ignorant' 
or 'unskilled' ; he therefore suggests that the proper reading here is, 
" ut non imperiti dLxere," " as some by no means ignorant persons have 
asserted." ^ The Attacori are also mentioned in B. vi. c. 2Q 

' SUlig omits the Trord "non" here, in which case the reading woula

them on to their neighbours, and so from one to the other, 
till they should have arrived at Delos. However, this 
custom, even, in time fell into disuse. 

The length of Sarmatia, Scjthia, and Taurica, and of the 
whole of the region which extends from the river Bory- 
sthenes, is, according to Agrippa, 980 miles, and its breadth 
717. I am of opinion, however, that in this part of the 
earth all estimates of measurement are exceedingly doubtful. 

CHAP. 27.— THE ISLANDS OF THE EUXINE. THE ISLANDS 
or THE NOETHEEN OCEAN. 

But now, in conformity vnth the plan which I originally 
proposed, the remaining portions of this gulf must be de- 
scribed. As for its seas, we have already made mention of 
them. 

(13.) The Hellespont has no islands belonging to Europe 
that are worthy of mention. In the Euxine there are, at a 
distance of a mile and a half from the European shore, and 
of fourteen from the mouth of the Strait, the two Cyansean^ 
islands, by some called the Symplegades^, and stated in fabu- 
lous story to have run the one against the other ; the reason 
being the circumstance that they are separated by so short 
an interval, that while to those who enter the Euxine opposite 
to them they appear to be two distinct islands, but if viewed 
in a somewhat oblique direction they have the appearance of 
becoming gradually united into one. On this side of the 
Ister there is the single island^ of the Apolloniates, eighty 
miles from the Thracian Bosporus ; it was from this place 
that M. Lucullus brought the Capitoline^ Apollo. Those 

^ These islands, or rather rocks, are now known as Fanari, and lie at 
the entrance of the Straits of Constantinople. 

2 From &lt;Tvv and TrXrjyrf, "a striking together." Tournefort has ex- 
plained the ancient story of these islands runnmg together, by remarking 
that each of them consists of one craggy island, but that when the sea is 
distui'bed the water covers the lower parts, so as to make the different 
points of each resemble isolated rocks. They are united to the maioland 
by a kind of isthmus, and appear as islands only when it is inundated in 
stormy weather. 

3 Upon which the city of Apollonia (now Sizeboh), mentioned in 
C 18 of the present Book, was situate.

"was tliii'ty cubits in height.

islands which are to be found between the moutlis of the 
Ister we have already mentioned^ Before the Borysthenes 
is Achillea" previously referred to, known also by the names 
of Leuce and Macaron^. Researches which have been made 
at the present day place this island at a distance of 140 miles 
from the Borysthenes, of 120 from Tyra, and of fil'ty from 
the island of Pence. It is about ten miles in circumference. 
The remaining islands in the Gulf of Carcinites are Cepha- 
lonnesos, Rhosphodusa, and Macra. Before we leave the 
Euxine, we must not omit to notice the opinion expressed 
by many writers that all the interior^ seas take their rise in 
this one as the principal source, and not at the Straits of 
Gades. The reason they give for this supposition is not an 
improbable one — the fact that the tide is always running 
out of the Euxine and that there is never any ebb. 

AVe must now leave the Euxine to describe the outer por- 
tions'" of Europe. After passing the Riphsean mountains we

* As the whole of Phny's description of the northern shores of Europe 
is replete with difficulties and obscurities, we cannot do better than tran- 
scribe the learned remarks of M.Parisot, the Geographical Editor of Ajas- 
son's Edition, in reference to this subject. He says, " Before entering on 
the discussion of tliis portion of Pliny's geography, let us here obsen^e, once 
for all, that we shall not remark as worthy of our notice aU those ridiculous 
hypotheses which covJd only take their rise in ignorance, precipitation, or 
a love of the marvellous. We shall dechne then to recognize the Doflre- 
felds in the mountains of Sevo, the North Cape in the Promontory of 
Rubeas, and the Sea of Greenland in the Cronian Sea. The absurdity 
of these suppositions is proved by — I. The impossibility of the ancients 
ever making their way to these distant coasts without the aid of large 
vessels, the compass, and others of tliose apphances, aided by which Eu- 
ropean skill finds the greatest difficulty m navigating tliosc distant seas. 
II. The immense lacuna; wliich woidd be found to exist hi the. descrip- 
tions of these distant seas and shores : for not a word do we find about 
those numerous arcliipelagos which are found scatten'd tlirougliout tlio 
North Sea, not a word about Iceland, nor about the numberless seas and 
fiords on the coast of Norway. III. The abseniie of all remarks upon 
the local phamomena of these spots. The Norl.h Cape belongs to the 
second polar climate, the longest day there being two months and a half.

have now to follow the shores of the Northern Ocean on the 
left, until we arrive at Grades. In this direction a great 

theories, but one with wliich practically they had never made themselves 
acquainted ? — The only geographers who here merit our notice are those 
who are of opinion that in some of the coasts or islands here mentioned 
Pliny describes the Scandinavian Peninsida, and in others the Coast of 
Finland. The first question then is, to what pomt Pliny first carries us ? 
It is evident that from the Black Sea he transports himself on a sud- 
den to the shores of the Baltic, thus passing over at a single leap a con- 
siderable space filled with nations and unknown deserts. The question 
then is, what hne has he followed ? Supposing our author had had before 
his eyes a modern map, the imaginary hne which he would have drawn 
in making this transition would have been from Odessa to the Kurisch- 
Haif. In this direction the breadth across Europe is contracted to a 
space, between the two seas, not more than 268 leagues in length. A 
very shnple mode of reasoning will conclusively prove that Pliny has 
deviated httle if anytliing from this route. If he fails to state in precise 
terms upon what point of the shores of the Baltic he ahghts after leaving 
the Riphsean mountains, his enumeration of the rivers which discharge 
themselves into that sea, and with which he concludes his account of 
Germany, will supply us with the requisite information, at aU events in 
great part. In following his description of the coast, we find mention 
madeof the following rivers, theGuttalus, the Vistula, theElbe, theWeser, 
the Ems, the Rhine, and the Meuse. The five last mentioned follow in 
their natm^al order, from east to west, as was to be expected in a descrip- 
tion starting from the east of Europe for its western extremity and the 
shores of Cadiz. We have a right to conclude then that the Guttalus 
was to the east of the Vistula. As we shall now endeavour to show, 
this river was no other than the Alle, a tributary of the Pregel, wliich 
the Romans probably, in advancing from west to east, considered as the 
principal stream, from the circximstance that they met with it, before 
coming to the larger river. The Pregel after being increased by the waters 
of the Alle or Guttalus falls into the Frisch-Hafi", about one degree 
fm-ther west than the Kurisch-Haff. It may however be here remarked, 
Why not find a river more to the east, the Niemen, for instance, or the 
Duna, to be represented by the Gruttalus ? The Niemen ha especial would 
suit in every respect equally well, because it discharges itself into the 
Kurisch-HalT. This conjecture however is incapable of support, when 
we reflect that the ancients were undoubtedly acquainted with some 
points of the coast to the east of the mouth of the Guttalus, but which, 
according to the system followed by oux author, wovdd form part of the 
Continent of Asia. These points are, 1st. The Cape Lytaiifiis (men- 
tioned by Phny, B. vi. c. 4). 2ndly. The mouth of the river Carambucis 
(similarly mentioned by him), and 3rdly, a little to the east of Cape Ly- 
tarmis, the moutli of the Tanais. The name of Cape Lytarmis suggests 
to us Lithuania, and probably represents Domess-Ness in Command ; the 
Carambucis can be no other than the Niemen ; while the Tanais, xipon 
which 80 many authors, ancient and modern, have exhausted their con- 



Chap. 27.] ACCOITNT OF COTTNTRIES, ETC. 341 

number of islands^ are said to exist that have no name ; among 
which there is one Avhich lies opposite to Scythia, mentioned 
under the name of Eaunonia'-, and said to be at a distance 
of the day's sail from the mainland ; and upon which, accord- 
ing to Timaeus, amber is thrown up by the waves in the spring 
season. As to the remaining parts of these shores, they are 
only known from reports of doubtful authority. "With refer- 
ence to the SeptentrionaP or Northern Ocean; Hecataeus 
calls it, after we have passed the mouth of the river Parapa- 
nisus, where it washes the Scythian shores, the Amalchian 

jectures, from confounding it with the Southern Tanais which falls into 
the Sea of Azof, is evidently the same as the Dw-ina or Western Dmia. 
Tliis is estabhshed incontrovertibly both by its geographical position (the 
mouth of the Dwina being only fifty leagues to tlie east of Domess-Ness) 
and the identity evidently of the names Dwma and Tanais. Long since, 
Leibnitz was the first to remark the presence of the radical T. «, or D. w, 
either with or without a vowel, in the names of the great rivers of Eastern 
Europe ; Danapris or Dnieper,' Danaster or Dniester, Danube (in Grer- 
man Donau, in Hungarian Duna), Tanais or Don, for example; all 
which rivers however discharge tliemselves into the Black Sea. There 
can be httle doubt then of the identity of the Duna with the Tanais, it 
being the only body of water in these vast comitries which bears a name 
resembhng the initial Tan, or Tn, and at the same time belongs to the 
basm of the Baltic. We are aware, it is true, that the AMiite Sea re- 
ceives a river Dwina, which is commonly called the Northern Dwina, 
but there can be no real necessity to be at the trouble of combating the 
opinion that this river is identical with the Northern Tanais. As the 
result tlien of our investigations, it is at the eastern extremity of the 
Frisch-Haff and near the mouth of the Pregel, that we would place the 
point at which Phny sets out. As for the Riphacan mountains, they have 
never existed anywhere but in the head of the geographers from whom 
our author drew his materials. From the momitains of Ural and Poias, 
wliich Pliny could not possibly have in view, seeing that tliey lie in a 
meridian as eastern as the Caspian Sea, the traveller has to proceed 600 
leagues to the south-west without meeting with any chains of mountains 
or indeed considerable elevations." 

^ It is pretty clear that he refers to the numerous islands scattered over 
the face of the Baltic Sea, such as Dago, Oesel, GolhlantI, and Aland. 

2 The old reading here was Bannomanna, which Dupinet woukl trans- 
late by the modem Bomholm. Parisot considers that the modern Runa, 
a calcareous rock covered with vegetable earth, in the vicinity of Domess- 
Ness, is the place indicated. 

3 It has been suggested by Broticr that Pliny here refers to the Icy 
Sea, but it is more probable that he refers to tlie north-eastern part of 
the Baltic, wliich was looked upon by the ancients as fonuiug part of 
the open sea.

sea, the word ' Amalcliian' signifying in tlie language of these 
races, frozen, Philemon again says that it is called Morima- 
rusa or the " Dead Sea" by the Cimbri, as far as the Promon- 
tory of Eubeas, beyond which it has the name of the Cro- 
nian^ Sea. Xenophon of Lampsacus tells us that at a distance 
of three days' sail from the shores of Scythia, there is an 
island of immense size called Baltia^, which by Pytheas is 
called Basilia^. Some islands'* called Oonse are said to be 

1 With reference to these divisions of land and sea, a subject which is 
involved in the greatest obscurity, Parisot states it as his opinion that 
the Amalchian or Icy Sea is that portion of the Baltic wliich extends 
fi'om Cape Rutt to Cape Grinea, wliile on the other hand the Cronian 
Sea comprehends all the gulfs which lie to the east of Cape Rutt, such 
as the Ilaff, the gulfs of Stettin and Danzic, the Frisch-Hafi', and the Ku- 
risch-HafF. He also tliinks that the name of 'Cronian' oi'iginaUy belonged 
only to that portion of the Baltic which washes the coast of Courland, 
but that travellers gradually apphed the term to the whole of the sea. 
He is also of opinion that the word " Cronium" owes its origin to the 
Teutonic and Danish adjective groen or " green." The extreme verdure 
wliich characterizes the islands of the Danish archipelago has given to 
the piece of water wliich separates the islands of Falster and Moen the 
name of Grroensimd, and it is far from improbable that the same epithet 
was given to the Pomeranian and Prussian Seas, which the Romans wovdd 
be not unhkely to call 'Gronium' or 'Cronium fretum,' or 'Cronium 
mare.' In the name 'Parapanisus' he also discovers a resemblance to that 
of modern Pomerania. 

2 Upon this Parisot remarks that on leaving Cape Rutt, at a distance 
of about twenty-five leagues in a straight hne, we come to the island of 
Funen or Fyen, commonly called Fionia, the most considerable of the 
Danish archipelago next to Zealand, and wliich lying between the two 
Belts, the Greater and the Smaller, may very probably from that cir- 
cumstance have obtained the name of Baltia. Brotier takes Baltia to 
be no other than Nova Zembla — so conflicting are the opinions of com- 
mentators ! 

3 Parisot suggests that under tliis name may possibly He concealed 
that of the modern island of Zealand or Seeland, and that it may have 
borne on the side of it next to the Belt the name of Baltseeland, easily 
corrupted by the Greeks into Basiha. 

^ Brotier takes these to be the islands of Aloo, and Bieloi or Ostrow, 
at the mouth of the river Paropanisus, wliich he considers to be the same 
as the Obi. Parisot on the other hand is of opinion that islands of the 
Baltic are here referred to ; that from the resemblance of the name Oonae 
to the Greek wor, "an egg," the story that the natives subsisted on the 
eggs of birds was formed ; that not improbably the group of the Hippo- 
podes resembled the shape of a horse- shoe, from which the story men- 
tioned by Pliny took its rise j and that the Fanesii (or, as the reading here 



Chap. 27.] ACCOU^fT OF COUNTEIES, ETC. 843 

here, the inhahitants of which live on the eggs of birds 
and oats ; and others again upon which human beings 
are produced witli the feet of horses, thence called Hippo- 
podes. Some other islands are also mentioned as those of 
tlie Panotii, the people of which have ears of such extra- 
ordinary size as to cover the rest of the body, which is 
otherwise left naked. 

Leaving these however, we come to the nation of the In- 
gaevones\ the first in Grermany ; at which we begin to have 
some information upon which more implicit reliance can be 
placed. In their country is an immense mountain called 
Sevo^, not less than those of the Eiphaean range, and which 
forms an immense gulf along the shore as far as the Promon- 
tory of the Cimbri. This gulf, which has the name of the 
' Codanian,' is filled with islands ; the most famous among 
which is Scandinavia^, of a magnitude as yet unascertained : 
the only portion of it at all known is inhabited by the nation 
of the Hilleviones, who dwell in 500 villages, and call it a 
second world: it is generally supposed that the island of 

has it, the Panotii, "all-ears") wore their hair very short, from which 
circumstance their ears appeared to be of a larger size than usual. 

^ Tacitus spesks of three great groups of the German tribes, the In- 
gsevones forming the first thereof, and consisting of those wliieh dwelt on 
the margin of the ocean, the Hermiones in the interior, and the Istffivones 
in the east and south of Germany. We shall presently find that PHny 
adds two groups, the Vandih as the foiu-th, and the Peucini and Bastemse 
as the fifth. This classification however is thought to originate in a mis- 
take, for Zeuss has satisfactorily shown that the Vandili belonged to the 
Hermiones, and that Peucini and Basteruce are only names of individual 
tribes and not of groups of tribes. 

2 Bi'otier and other geographers are of opinion that by this name the 
chain of the Doffrefeld mountains is meant ; but this cannot be tlie case 
if we suppose with Parisot tliat Pliny here returns soutli from the Scan- 
dinavian islands and takes his departure from Cape Rutt in the territory 
of the Ingsevoncs. Still, it is quite impossible to say what mountains he 
would designate under the name of Sevo. Parisot sugg(&gt;sts that it is a form 
of the compound word " seevohner," " inhabitants of (lie sea," and that it 
is a general name for tlie elevated lands along the margin of the sea-shore. 

3 Parisot supposes that under this name the isle of Funen is meant, 
but it is more generally thought that Norway and Sweden are thus de- 
signated, as that peninsida was generally looked upon as an island by the 
ancients. The Codanian Gulf was the sea to the east of the Cimbrian 
Chersonesus or Jutland, filled with the islands which belong to the modem 
kingdom of Denmark. It was therefore the southern part of the Baltic. 



344 plint's NATUEAL HISTOET. [Book lY. 

Eningia^ is of not less magnitude. Some -writers state that 
these regions, as far as the river A^istula, are inhabited hj the 
Sarmati, the Yenedi', the Sciri, and the Hirri^, and that there 
is a gulf there known by the name of Cylipenus^, at the mouth 
of which is the island of Latris, after which comes another 
gulf, that of Lao-nus, which borders on the Cimbri. The 
Cimbrian Promontory, running out into the sea for a great 
distance, forms a peninsula which bears the name of Cartris^. 
Passing this coast, there are three and twenty islands which 
have been made known by the Eoman arms^: the most 
famous of which is Burcana^, called by our people Pabaria, 
from the resemblance borne ^ by a fruit Avhich grows there 
spontaneously. There are those also called Glaesaria^ by our 

1 By Eningia Hardouin thinks that the country of modem Finland is 
meant. Poinsinet thinks that mider the name are mcluded Ingria, Li- 
vonia, and Courland ; wlxile Parisot seems incUned to be of opinion that 
imder tliis name the island of Zealand is meant, a village of wliich, about 
three-fourths of a league from the western coast, according to him, stiU 
bears the name of Heininge. 

2 Parisot is of opinion that the Yenedi, also called Yinid* and Yin- 
dih, were of Sclavish origin, and situate on the shores of the Baltic. He 
remarks that this people, in the fifth century, founded in Pomerania, when 
quitted by the Goths, a kingdom, the chiefs of which styled themselves 
the Konjucs of Yinland. Their name is also to be foxmd in Yenden, a 
Hussian town in the government of Riga, in Windenbm'g in Courland, and 
in Wenden in the circle of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenbui'g Schwerin. 

' Parisot remarks that these two peoples were probably only tribes 
of the Yenedi, 

"^ Parisot feels convinced that Phny is speaking here of the Gulf of 
Travemunde, the island of Femeren, and then of the gulf wliich extends 
from that island to Kiel, where the Eider separates Holsteiu from Jut- 
land. On the other hand, Hardouin tliinks that by the Gulf of Cylipe- 
nus the Gulf of Riga is meant, and that Latris is the modern island of 
Oesel. But, as Parisot justly remarks, to put this construction on Pliny's 
language is to invert the order in which he has hitherto proceeded, evi- 
dently from east to west.

The whole of the shores of this sea as far as the Scaldis\ 
a river of G-ermany, is inhabited by nations, the dimensions 
of whose respective territories it is quite impossible to state, 
so immensely do the authors differ who have touched upon 
this subject. The Greek \\Titers and some of our own 
countrymen have stated the coast of Germany to be 2500 
miles in extent, while Agrippa, comprising Ehaetia and Nori- 
cum in his estimate, makes the length to be 686' miles, and 
the breadth 148 ^ (14.) The breadth of Ehaetia alone how- 
ever very nearly exceeds that number of miles, and indeed 
we ought to state that it was only subjugated at about the 
period of the death of that general ; while as for Germany, 
the whole of it was not thoroughly known to us for many 
years after his time. If I may be allowed to form a conjec- 
ture, the margin of the coast will be found to be not far short 
of the estimate of tlie Greek writers, while the distance in a 
straight line wiU nearly correspond with that mentioned by 
Agrippa. 

There are five German races ; the Vandili^, parts of whom 

figuratively " amber." Probably (Eland and Gotliland. They will be 
found again mentioned ia the Thirtieth Chapter of the present Book. 
See p. 351. ^ Now the Scheldt. 

2 In a straight line, of course. Parisot is of opinion that in forming 
this estimate Agrippa began at the angle formed by the river Piave in 
lat. 46° 4', measuring thence to Cape Rubeas (now Rutt) in lat. 54° 25'. 
This would give 8° 21', to wliicli, if we add some twenty leagues for obU- 
qviity or diti'erence of longitude, the total would make exactly the distance 
here mentioned. 

3 As Parisot remarks, it is totally impossible to conceive the source 
of such an erroneous conclusion as this. Some readings make the amount 
248, others 268. 

^ As already mentioned, Zeuss has satisfactorily 8ho^vn that the Van- 
diU or VindUi properly belonged to the llermiones. Tacitus mentions 
but three groups of the German nations ; the Inga;vones on the ocean, 
the Henniones in the interior, and the Istpcvones in tlie east and south 
of Germany. The VandiU, a Gothic race, dwelt originally on the northern 
coast of Germany, but afterwards settled north of the Marcomanni on the

are tlie Burgundiones\ tlie Yarini^, the Carini^, and tlie 
Grutones^; the Ingaevones, forming a second race, a por- 
tion of whom are the Cimbri\ the Teutoni^, and the tribes 

Riesengebirge. They subsequently appeared in Dacia and Pannonia, and 
in the beginning of the fifth century invaded Spain. Under Genseric they 
passed over into Afi'ica, and finally took and plundered Rome in A.D. 455. 
Their kingdom was finally destroyed by BeUsarius. 

^ It is supposed that the Burgundiones were a Gothic people dwelling 
in the country between the rivers Viadus and Vistula, though Armnianus 
MarceUinus declares them to have been of pure Roman origin. How 
they came into the country of the Upper Maine in the south-west of 
Germany in A.D. 289, liistorians have found themselves at a loss to in- 
form us. It is not improbable that the two peoples were not identical, 
and that the similarity of their name arose only from the circumstance that 
they both resided in " burgi" or burghs. See Gibbon, iii. 99. BohrCs Ed. 

2 The Varhii dwelt on the right bank of the Albis or Elbe, north of the 
Langobardi. Ptolemy however, who seems to mention them as the Ava- 
rini, speaks of them as dwelling near the sources of the Vistula, on the 
Bite of the present Cracow. See Gibbon, iv. 225. Bohn^s Ed. 

3 Nothing whatever is known of the locahty of tins people. 

^ They are also called in history Gothi, Gothones, Gotones and Gutse. 
According to Pytheas of Marseilles (as mentioned by Phny, B.xxsvii. 
c. 2), they dwelt on the coasts of the Baltic, in the vicinity of what is 
now called the Fritsch-Hafi*. Tacitus also refers to the same district, 
though he does not speak of them as inhabiting the coast. Ptolemy 
again speaks of them as dwelling on the east of the Vistula, and to the 
south of the Venedi. The later form of their name, Gothi, does not occur 
tiU the time of CaracaUa. Their native name was Gutthinda. They are 
first spoken of as a powerful nation at the beginning of the third cen- 
tury, when we find them mentioned as 'Gette,' fi'om the circumstance of 
their having occupied the countries formerly inhabited by the Sarmatian 
Getse. The formidable attacks made by this people, divided into the 
nations of the Ostrogoths and Visigoths, upon the Roman power during 
its decline, are too well known to every reader of Gibbon to require 
further notice. 

* The inhabitants of Chersonesus Cimbrica, the modern peninsula of 
Jutland. It seems doubtful whether these Cimbri were a Germanic na- 
tion or a Celtic tribe, as also whether they were the same race whose 
numerous hordes successively defeated six Roman armies, and were finally 
conquered by C. Marius, B.C. 101, in the Campi Raudii. The more 
general impression, however, entertained by liistorians, is that they were 
a Celtic or GaUic and not a Germanic nation. The name is said to have 
signified " robbers." See Gibbon, i. 273, iii. 365. Bolm's Ed. 

^ The Teutoni or Teutones dwelt on the coasts of the Baltic, adjacent 
to the territory of the Cimbri. Then* name, though belonging originally 
to a single nation or tribe, came to be afterwards apphed collectively to 
the whole people of Germany. See Gibbon, iii. 139. Bohti's Ed,

of the Chauci^ The Istsevones^, who join up to the Ehine, 
and to -^-hom the Cimbri^ belong, are the third race ; while 
the Hermiones, forming a fourth, dwell in the interior, 
and include the Suevi"*, the Hcrmunduri*, the Chatti*', and 

^ Also called Cauchi, Cauci, and Cayci, a German tribe to the east of 
the Frisians, between the rivers Ems and Elbe. The modern Olden- 
burg and Hanover are supposed to pretty nearly represent the country 
of the Chauci. In B. xvi. c. 1. 2, will be found a further account of them 
by PUny, -who had visited their countiT, at least that part of it which lay 
on the sea-coast. They are mentioned for the last time in the third cen- 
tury, when they had extended so far south and west that they are spoken 
of as living on the banks of the Kliine. 

2 Mentioned by Tacitus as dweUing in the east and south of Grcrmany. 

3 It has been suggested by Titzius that the words " quorum Cunbri," 
*' to whom the Cunbri belong," are an interpolation ; which is not un- 
probable, or at least that the word "Cimbri" has been substituted for 
some other name. 

* This a]:)pear3 to be properly the collective name of a great nvmaber of 
the German tribes, who were of a migi-atory mode of hfe, and spoken of 
in opposition to the more settled tribes, who went imder the general name 
of Ingsevones. Cffisar speaks of them as dweUing east of the Ubii and 
Sygambri, and west of the Cherusci. Strabo makes them extend in an 
easterly direction beyond the Albis or Elbe, and southerly as far as tho 
soiu-ces of the Danube. Tacitus gives the name of Suevia to the whole 
of the east of Germany, from the Danube to the Baltic. The name of 
the modem Suabia is derived from a body of adventurers from various 
German tribes, who assimied the name of Suevi in consequence of their 
not possessing any other appellation. 

^ A large and powerful tribe of Germany, which occupied the exten- 
sive tract of country between the moimtains in the north-west of Bohe- 
mia and the Roman Wall in the south-west, which formed the boundary 
of the Agri Decumates. On the east they bordered on the Narisei, on 
the north-east on the Cherusci, and on tlie north-west on the Chatti. 
There is httle doubt that they originally formed part of the Suevi. At 
a later period tliey spread in a north-easterly direction, taking possession 
• of the north-western part of Bohemia and tlie country about tlie sources 
of the Maine and Saale, that is, the }iart of Franeonia as far as Kissingen 
and the south-western part of the kingdom of Saxony. The name ller- 
munduri is tliought by some to signify higlilanders, and to be a com- 
pound oi Her or Ar, "high," and Mund, "man." 

^ One of the great tribes of Germany, which rose to importance after 
the decay of the power of the Cherusci, It is thouglit by ellmograjihers 
that their name is stiU preserved in the word "Hessen." Tlu-y formed tho 
chief tribe of the Hermiones liere mentioned, and are described by Cjrsar 
as belonging to the Suevi, though Tacitus ilistinguishes them, and no 
German tribe in fact occujjied more permanently its original loeahty than 
the Chatti. Their original abode seems to have extended from the Wester-

the Cherusci^ : the fifth race is that of the Peucini', who are 
also the Basternae, adjoining the Daci previously mentioned. 
The more famous rivers that flow into the ocean are the 
Gruttalus^ the Vistillus or Vistula, the Albis"*, the Yisurgis^ 
the Amisius®, the Rhine, aiM the Mosa''. In the interior is 
the long extent of the Hercjnian^ range, which in grandeur 
is inferior to none. 

•wald in the west to the Saale in Franconia, and from the river Maine 
in the south as far as the sources of the Ehson and the Weser, so that 
they occupied exactly the modern country of Hessen, inchidmg perhaps 
a portion of the north-west of Bavaria. See Gribbon, vol. iii. 99, JSohn's Ed. 
^ The Cherusci were the most celebrated of all the Grerman tribes, and 
are mentioned by Caesar as of the same importance as the Suevi, from 
whom they were separated by the Silva Bacensis. There is some diffi- 
culty in stating their exact locahty, but it is generally supposed that 
their country extended from the Visurgis or Weser in the west to the 
Albis or Elbe in the east, and fi'om MeUbocus in the north to the neigh- 
bourhood of the Sudeti in the south, so that the Chamavi and Lango- 
bardi were their northern neighbours, the Chatti the western, the Her- 
munduri the southern, and the Sihngi and Semnones their eastern 
neighbours. Tliis tribe, mider their chief Arminius or Hermann, form- 
ing a confederation with many smaller tribes in a.d. 9, completely defeated 
the Romans in the famou.s battle of the Teutoburg Forest. In later times 
they were conquered by the Chatti, so that Ptolemy speaks of them 
only as a small tribe on the south of the Hartz mountain. Their name 
afterwards appears, in the beginning of the fourth centmy, in the con- 
federation of the Franks. 

2 The Peucini are mentioned here, as also by Tacitus, as identical with 
the Bastemse. As already mentioned, supposing them to be names for 
distinct nations, they must be taken a*^ only names of individual tribes, 
and not of groups of tribes. It is generally supposed that their first 
settlements in Sarmatia were in the highlands between the Theiss and 
the March, whence they passed onward to the lower Danube, as far as 
its mouth, where a portion of them, settling in the island of Pence, ob- 
tained the name of Peucini. In the later geographers we find them 
settled between the Tyrus or Dniester, and the Borysthenes or Dnieper, 
the Peucini remaining at the mouth of the Danube. 

3 According to Parisot, the GTuttalus is the same as the Alle, a tribu- 
tary of the Pregel. Cluver thinks that it is the same as the Oder. 
Other writers again consider it the same as the Pregel.

* The ' Hercynia Silva,' Hercynian Forest or Range, is very differently 

described by the writers of various ages. The earUest mention of it is 
by Aristotle. Judging from the accovmts given by Csesar, Pomponius 
Mela, and Strabo, the ' Hercynia SUva' appears to have been a general 
name for almost all the mountains of Southern and Central G-ermany, 
that is, from the sources of the Danube to Transylvania, comprising the

CHAP. 29. (15.) — NINETY-SIX ISLANDS OF THE GALLIC OCEAN. 

In the Ehine itself, nearly 100 miles in length, is the 
most famous island^ of the Bata^d and the Canniuefates, as 
also other islands of the I'risii", the Chauei, tlie Frisia- 
bones^, the Sturii"', and the Marsaeii, which lie between He- 
lium' and Flevum^. These are the names of tlie moutha 

Schwarzwald, Odenwald, Spcssart, Ehon, Tliiiringer Wald, the Hartz 
mountain (which seems in a great measiire to have retained the ancient 
name), Raube Alp, Steigerwald, Ficlitelgcbirge, Erzgcbirge, and Riesen- 
gebirge. At a later period when the mountains of Germany had become 
better known, the name was apphed to the more limited range extending 
around Bohemia, and through Moravia into Hvmgary. 

^ This island appears to have been formed by the bifurcation of the 
Ehine, the northern branch of which enters the sea at Katwj^ck, a few 
miles north of Leyden, by the Waal and the com'se of the Maas, after it has 
received the Waal, and by the sea. The Waal or Vahahs seems to have 
undergone considerable changes, and the place of its junction with the 
Maas may have varied. Phny makes the island nearly 100 miles in length, 
wliich is about the distance fi'om the fort of Schenkenschanz, where the 
first separation of the Ehine takes place, to the mouth of the Maas. The 
name of Batavia was no doubt the genuine name, which is stiU preserved 
in Betuwe, the name of a district at the bifiu-cation of the Ehine and the 
Waal. The Canninefates, a people of the same race as the Batavi, also 
occupied the island, and as the Batavi seem to have been in the eastern 
part, it is supposed that the Canniuefates occupied the western. They 
were subdued by Tiberius in the reign of Augustus. 

2 The Frisii or Frisones were one of the great tribes of north-western 
Germany, properly belonging to the group of the Inga?vones. They in- 
habited the covmtry about Lake Flevo and other lakes, between the Ehine 
and the Ems, so as to be bounded on the south by the Bructeri, and on 
the east by the Chauei. Tacitus distinguishes between the Frisii Ma- 
jorcs and Minorcs, and it is supposed tliat the latter dwelt on the east of 
the canal of Drusus in the north of Holland, and the former between the 
rivers Flevus and Amisia, that is, in the coimtiy which stnU bears the 
name of Friesland. The Chauei have been previously mentioned. 

3 The Frisiabones or Frisfcvones are again mentioned m C. 31 of the 
present Book as a people of Gaul. In what locality they dwelt has not 
been ascertained by historians. 

4 The Sturii are supposed to liave inhabited the modem South IIoDand, 
while the IMarsacii probably inhabited the island which tlie Meuso fonna 
at its junction with the Eliine, at the ntodern Dortn^cht in Zealand. 

* Supposed to be the site of the modem fortress of Briel, situate at 
the mouth of the Meuse. 

' Probably the same as the modem Ylieland (thus partly retaining its 
ancient name), an island north of the Texel. The more ancient writers 
speak of two main arms, into which the Ehine was divided on entering 



850 PIIKT's NATTTEAL HISTOET. [Book IV. 

into wliich the Ehine divides itself, discharging its waters on 
the north into the lakes there, and on the west into the river 
Mosa. At the middle mouth which lies between these two, 
the river, having but a very small channel, preserves its own 
name. 

CHAP. 30. (16,) — BEITAKNIA. 

Opposite to this coast is the island called Britannia, so 
celebrated in the records of Gi-reece^ and of our own country. 
It is situate to the north-west, and, with a large tract of 
intervening sea, lies opposite to Grermany, Gaul, and Spain, 
by far the greater part of Europe. Its former name was 
Albion^ ; but at a later period, all the islands, of which we 
shall just now briefly make mention, Avere included under the 
name of " Britannise." This island is distant from Gesoriacum, 
on the coast of the nation of the Morini^, at the spot where 
the passage across is the shortest, fifty miles. Pytheas and 
Isidorus say that its circumference is 4875 miles. It is 
barely thirty years since any extensive knowledge of it was 
gained by the successes of the E-oman arms, and even as yet 
they have not penetrated beyond the vicinity of the Caledo- 
nian^ forest. Agrippa believes its length to be 800 miles, and 

the territory of the Batavi, of which the one on the east continued to bear 
the name of Rhenus, while that on the west into which the Masa, Maas 
or Meuse, flowed, was called Vahalis or Waal. After Drusus, B.C. 12, 
had connected the Flevo Lacus or Zuyder-Zee with the Rhine hy means 
of a canal, m forming which he probably made use of the bed of the 
Yssel, we find mention made of three mouths of the Rhine. Of these 
the names, as given by Phny, are, on the west, HeUum (the Vahahs of 
other writers), in the centre Rhenus, and at the north Flevum ; but at 
a later period we again find mention made of only two mouths. 

1 Britain was spoken of by some of the Grreek writers as superior to 
all other islands in the world. Pionysius, in his Periegesis, says, " that 
no other islands whatsoever can claim equahty with those of Britain." 

2 Said to have been so called from the whiteness of its cliffs opposite 
the coast of Gaul. 

3 Afterwards called Bononia, the modem Boulogne. As D'AnviUe 
remarks, the distance here given by PUny is far too great, whether we 
measure to Dover or to Hythe ; our author's measurement however is 
probably made to Rutupise (the modem Richborough), near Sandwich, 
where tlie Romans had a fortified post, wliich was their landing-place 
when crossing over from Graul. This would make the distance given by 
Phny nearer the truth, though still too much. 

* Probably the Grrampian range is here referred to.

its breadth 300 ; he also thinks that the breadth of Hibernia 
is the same, but that its length is less by 200 miles. This 
last island is situate beyond Britannia, the passage across 
being the shortest from the territory of the Silures\ a distance 
of thirty miles. Of the remaining islands none is said to 
have a greater circumference than 125 miles. Among these 
there are the Orcades", forty in number, and situate within 
a short distance of each other, the seven islands called Ac- 
modce^, the HtTbudes, thirty in number, and, between Hi- 
bernia and Britannia, the islands of Mona'*,Monapia^,Eicina®, 
Vectis^ Limnus^, and Andros'. Below it are the islands 
called Samnis and Axantos'", and opposite, scattered in the 
German Sea, are those known as the Grlsesarise^^, but which 

^ The people of South Wales. 

' The Orkney islands Tvere included under this name. Pomponius 
Mela and Ptolemy make them but tliirty in number, while Sohnus Qxes 
their number at three only. 

3 Also called ^modse or Hsemodse, most probably the islands now 
known as the Shetlands. Camden however and the older antiquarians 
refer the Hsemodse to the Baltic sea, considering them ditferent from the 
Acmoda; here mentioned, wliile Salmasius on the other hand considers the 
Acmodae or Hsemodse and the Hebrides as identical. Parisot remarks 
that off the West Cape of the Isle of Skye and the Isle of North Uist, 
the nearest of the Het rides to the Shetland islands, there is a vast gulf 
filled with islands, which still bears the name of Mamaddy or ISIaddy, 
from which the Grreeks may have easily derived the words At MaSdaly 
whence the Latin Hsemodse. 

^ The Isle of Anglesea. ^ Most probably the Isle of Man. 

^ Camden and Gosselin (JRecJi. stir la Geogr. des Anciens) consider 
that under this name is meant the island of Rackhn, situate near the 
north-eastern extremity of Ireland. A Ricina is spoken of by Ptolemy, 
but that island is one of the Hebrides. 

7 This Vectis is considered by Gossehn to be the same as the small 
island of White-Horn, situate at the entrance of the Bay of Wigtown in 
Scotland. It must not be confounded with the more southern Vectis, or 
Isle of Wight. 

^ According to Gosselin this is the island of Dalkey, at the entrance of 
Dubhn Bay. 

3 Camden thinks that this is the same as Bardsey Island, at the south 
of the island of Anglesea, wlule Manncrt and Gosselin tliink that it is 
the island of Lambay. 

^^ Accorchng to Brotier these islands belong to the coast of Britaimy, 
being the modem isles of Sian and Ushant.

and Gothl md, and Amelund, called Au&gt;teravia or Actania, in which

the G-reeks liave more recently called tlie Electrides, from 
the circumstance of their producing electrum or amber. 
The most remote of all that we find mentioned is Thule\ in 
which, as we have previously stated^, there is no night at the 
summer solstice, when the sun is passing through the sign 
of Cancer, while on the other hand at the winter solstice 
there is no day. Some writers are of opinion that this state 
of things lasts for six whole months together. Timseus the 
historian says that an island called Mictis^ is within six days' 
sail of Britannia, in which white lead"* is found ; and that the 
Britons sail over to it in boats of osier', covered with sewed 
hides. There are writers also who make mention of some 
other islands, Scandia^ namely, Dunma, Bergos, and, greater 

1 The opinions as to the identity of ancient Thule have been numerous 
in the extreme. We may here mention six : — 1. The common, and ap- 
parently the best foimded opinion, that Thule is the island of Iceland. 
2. That it is either the Ferroe group, or one of those islands. 3. The 
notion of Ortehus, Farnaby, and Schoenning, that it is identical with 
Thylemark in Norway. 4. The opinion of Malte Brun, that the conti- 
nental portion of Denmark is meant thereby, a part of which is to the 
present day caUed Thy or Thy land. 5. The opinion of Eudbeck and of 
Calstron, borrowed originally from Procopius, that this is a general 
name for the whole of Scandinavia. 6. That of Gossehn, who thinks 
that under tliis name Mainland, the principal of the Shetland Islands, is 
meant. It is by no means impossible that under the name of Thule 
two or more of these locahties may have been meant, by different authors 
writing at distant periods and under different states of geograpliical 
knowledge. It is also pretty generally acknowledged, as Parisot re- 
marks, that the Thule mentioned by Ptolemy is identical with Thylemark 
in Norway. ^ 2 g. ii. c. 77. 

3 Brotier thinks that under this name a part of Cornwall is meant, and 
that it was erroneously supposed to be an island. Parisot is of opinion 
that the copyists, or more probably Phny himself, has made an error in 
transcribing Mictis for Vectis, the name of the Isle of Wight. It is not 
improbable however that the island of Mictis had only an imagmary 
existence.

^ Brotier, with, many other writers, takes these names to refer to va- 
rious parts of the coast of Norway. Scandia he considers to be the same 
as Scania, Bergos the modern Bergen, and Nerigos the northern part of 
Norway. On the other hand, Gossehn is of opinion that vmder the name 
of Bergos the Scottish island of Barra is meant, and under that of Neri-

CHAP. 31. (17.) — GALLIA BELGICA. 

The whole of Gaul that is comprehended under the one 
general name of Comata^, is divided into three races of 
people, which are more especially kept distinct from each 
other by the following rivers. From the Scaldis to the Se- 
quana- it is Belgic G-aul ; from the Sequana to the Garumna^ 
it is Celtic Gaul or Lugdunensis"* ; and from the Garumna 
to the promontory of the Pyrensean range it is Aquitanian 
Gaul, formerly called Aremorica*. Agrippa makes the en- 
tire length of the coast of Gaul to be 1800 miles, mea- 
sured from the Ehine to the Pyrenees : and its length, 
from the ocean to the mountains of Gebenna and Jura, 
excluding therefrom Gallia Xarbonensis, he computes at 
420 miles, the breadth being 318. 

Beginning at the Scaldis, the parts beyond^ are inliabited 
by the Toxandri, who are divided into various peoples with 
many names ; after whom come the Menapii', the Morini^, 
the Oromarsaci^, who are adjacent to the burgh which is 
known asGesoriacum'*^, theBritanni'\ the Ambiani^'^, theBel- 

gos, the island of Lewis, the BOi'them promontory of which is in the old 
maps designated by the name of Narj- or Nery. Ptolemy makes men- 
tion of an island called Doumna in the vicinity of the i rcades. 

1 Transalpine Gaul, with the exception of that part of it called Nar- 
bonensis, was called Gallia Comata, fi-om the custom of the people 
allo\^'ing their hair to grow to a great length.

else is known. The name is omitted iti several of the editions. 

3 D'Anville is of opinion that thefr chief town was situate at the 
modern Chaom-s, at the passage of the river Serre, not far from Vervias 
in the dejjartment of the Aisne. 

* Accordhig to Ptolemy their chief town would be on the site of the 
modern Orchies in the department du Nord, but Csesar makes it to be 
Nemetacum, the modem Arras, the capital of the department of the 
Pas de Calais. 

^ According to Ansart their chief town was Bavai, in the department 
du Nord. They are called " Liberi," or free, because they were left at 
liberty to enjoy their own laws and institutions.

gested that the place called Vermand, in the department de 1' Aisne, de- 
notes its site ; but according to BeUay and D'Anville the city of St. 
Quentin, which was formerly called Aouste, mai'ks the spot.

which follows.

vicinity probably of the place wliich still bears the name of Beetz, upon 
the river Gette, between Leau and Haclen, seven miles to the east of 
Louvain.

occupied the departments of the Basses Pyi'enees, or Lower Pyrenees. 

^ So called from the Latin verb convenire, "to assemble" or "meet 
together." They are said to have received this name from the circum- 
stance that Ptolemy, after the close of the Sertorian war, finding a pas- 
toral people of predatory habits inhabiting the range of the Pyrenees, 
ordered them to unite together and form a community in a town or city. 
From them the present town of Saint Bertrand de Comminges, in the 
S.W. of the department of the Haute Garonne, derives its Latin name 
*'Lugdunum Convenarum," 

' By Csesar called the Bigerriones. Their name was preserved in that 
of the district of Bigorre, now the department of the Hautes-Pyrenees. 
Their cliief town was Turba, now Tarbes. 

^ By calling the Tarbelli Quatuorsignani, he seems to imply that 
their cliief town was a place garrisoned by four maniples of soldiers, each 
■with a signiim or standard. Aquse Tarbelhcse was their chief town, the 
modern Acqs or Dax, in the S.W. of the department of the Landes. 

^ Their chief town was probably garrisoned by six signa or maniples. 
Cocosa, or Coequosa, as it is written in the Antonine Itinerary, is the first 
place on a road from Aquae Tarbelhcse or Dax to Burdegala or Bordeaux, 
now called Marensin. Their locality was in the southern part of the 
department of the Landes, the inhabitants of which are still divided into 
two classes, the Bouges, those of the north, or of the Tete de Buch ; and 
the Cousiots, those of the south. ^"^ Their locahty is unknown.

tory, while many call it the Promontory of Olisipo, from 
the city^ near it. This spot forms a dividing line in the 
land, the sea, and the heavens. Here ends one side^ of 
Spain ; and, when we have doubled the promontory, the 
front of Spain begins. (22.) On one side of it lie the North 
and the Grallic Ocean, on the other the "West and the Atlantic. 
The length of this promontory has been estimated by some 
persons at sixty miles, by others at ninety. A considerable 
number of writers estimate the distance from this spot to 
the Pyrenees at 1250 miles ; and, committing a manifest 
error, place here the nation of the Artabri, a nation 
that never^ was here. Per, making a slight change in the 
name, they have placed at this spot the Arrotrebge, whom 
we have previously spoken of as dwelling in front of the 
Celtic Promontory. 

Mistakes have also been made as to the more celebrated 
rivers. Prom the Minius, which we have previously men- 
tioned, according to Varro, the river ^minius^ is distant 
200 miles, which others^ suppose to be situate elsewhere, 
and called Limsea. By the ancients it was called the " Kiver 
of Oblivion," and it has been made the subject of many 
fabulous stories. At a distance of 200 miles from the 
Durius is the Tagus, the Munda^ Ijii^g between them. 
The Tagus is famous, for its golden sands''. At a distance 

a very curiou8 error. He mentions a promontory called Artabrum as 
the headland at the N. W. extremity of Spain ; the coast on the one side of 
it looking to the north and the Grallic Ocean, on the other to the west and 
the Atlantic Ocean. But he considers this promontory to be the west 
headland of the estuary of the Tagus^ and adds, that some called it 
Magnum Promontorium, or the " Great Promontory," and others OHsi- 
ponense, from the city of OUsipo, or Lisbon. He assigns, in fact, all the 
west coast of Spain, down to the mouth of the Tagus, to the north 
coast, and, instead of being led to detect liis error by the resemblance of 
name between his Artabrum Promontorium and liis Arrotrebse (the 
Artabri of his predecessors, Strabo and Mela), he perversely finds fault 
with those who had placed above the promontory Artabrum, a people of 
the same name who never were there.

from nearly the very middle of the front- of JSpaiu. From

CHAP. 36. — THE ISLANDS IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. 

Opposite to Celtiberia are a number of islands, by the 
Greeks called Cassiterides^in consequence of their abounding 
in tin : and, facing the Promontory^ of the Arrotreba?, are 
the six Islands of the Gods, which some persons have 
called the Fortunate Islands^. At the very commencement 

^ Mannert is of opinion that the city of Lancia was situate in the 
north of Lusitania, on the river Durius, or Douro, near the modern 
Zamora. 

2 To distinguish them from the IMirobrigenses, sumamcd Turduli, 
mentioned in B. iii. c. 3. Some writers think that this Mii-obriga is the 
present Ciudad Eodrigo ; but Ambrose Morales takes it to be the place 
called Malabriga, in the vicinity of that city. 

3 The name of Medubriga was afterwards Aramenha, of which Har- 
douin says the ruins only were to be seen. They were probably called 
JPlumharii, from lead mines in their vicmity. 

■* According to Hardouin, Ocelum was in the vicroity of the modem 
Capara. 

» From Cape de Creuz to the Promontory between the cities of Fon- 
tarabia and Saint Sebastian. 

^ From the Greek jcacrcrtrepos, " tin." It is generally supposed that the 
" Tin Islands" were the Scilly Isles, in the vicinity of Cornwall. At the 
same time the Greek and Koman geographers, borrowing their knowlodgo 
from the accounts probably of the Phoenician merchants, soem to have had 
a very indistinct notion of their precise locality, antl to have thought them 
to be nearer to Spain than to Britain. Thus we fhid Strabo, in B. iii., 
saying, that " the Cassiterides are ten in number, lying near eacli other 
in the ocean, towards the rxorih. from the haven of the Ariabri." From 
a comparison of the accounts, it would almost ajjpear that the ancient 
geographers confused the Scilly Islands with the Azores, as those, who 
enter into any detail, attribute to the Cassiterides the characteristics 
almost as much of the Azores and the sea in their vicinity, aa of the 
Scilly Islands. 7 Capo Finisterre.

of Eaetica, and Wenty-five miles from the moufh of the 
Straits of Grades, is the island of Gradis, twelve miles long 
and three broad, as Polybius states in his writings. At its 
nearest part, it is less than 700 feet^ distant from the main- 
land, while in the remaining portion it is distant more than 
seven miles. Its circuit is fifteen miles, and it has on it a 
city which enjoys the rights of Eoman citizens^, and whose 
people are called the Augustani of the city of Julia 
Graditana. On the side which looks towards Spain, at about 
100 paces distance, is another long island, three miles wide, 
on wliich the original city of Grades stood. By Ephorus and 
Philistides it is called Erythia, by Timseus and Silenus Aphro- 
disias^, and by the natives the Isle of Juno. Timaeus says, 
that the larger island used to be called Cotinusa'*, from its 
portion of the article on tliis subject in Dr. Smith's "Dictionary of 
Ancient Geography." " ' Fortunatse Instilae' is one of those geograpliical 
names whose origm is lost in mythic darkness, but wliich afterwards 
came to have a specific apphcation, so closely resembling the old mythical 
notion, as to make it almost impossible to doubt that that notion was 
based, in part at least, on some vague knowledge of the regions afterwards 
discovered. The earliest Grreek poetry places the abode of the happy 
departed spirits far beyond the entrance of the Mediterranean, at the 
extremity of the earth, and upon the shores of the river Oceanus, or in 
islands in its midst ; and Homer's poetical description of the place may 
be apphed almost word for word to those islands in the Atlantic, off the 
west coast of Africa, to wliich the name was given in the historical 
period. (Od. iv. 1. 563, seq.) ' There the life of mortals is most easy ; 
there is no snow, nor whiter, nor much rain, but Ocean is ever senduig 
up the shrill breatliing breezes of Zephyrus to refresh men.' Their de- 
hcious cHmate, and their supposed identity of situation, marked out the 
Canary Islands, the Madeira group, and the Azores, as worthy to re- 
present the Islands of the Blest. In the more specific sense, however, 
the name was appUed to the two former groups ; wliile, in its widest 
apphcation, it may have even included the Cape de Verde Islands, its 
extension being in fact adapted to that of maritime discovery." Plhiy 
gives a further description of them in B. vi. c. 37. 

^ The strait between the island and the mainland is now called the 
Hiver of Saint Peter. The circuit of the island, as stated by Pliny, 
varies m the MSS. from fifteen to twenty-five nules, and this last is pro- 
bably correct. 

2 Juhus Csesar, on his visit to the city of Grades, during the CivU War 
in Spain, B.C. 49, conferred the citizenship of Kome on aU the citizens of 
Gadcs. Under Augustus it became a municipium, with the title of 
* Augusta urbs Juha Gaditana.' The modern city of Cadiz is biult upon 
its site. 2 Or the Island of Venus.

olives ; the Eomans call it Tartessos^ ; the Carthaginians 
Gadir', that Avord in the Puuic language signifying a hedge. 
It was called Erythia because the Tyrians, the original an- 
cestors of the Carthaginians, Avere said to have come from 
the Erythraean, or Red Sea. In this island Greryon is by 
some thought to have dwelt, whose herds were carried off 
by Hercules. Other persons again think, that his island 
is another one, opposite to Lusitania, and that it was there 
formerly called by that name^. 

CHAP. 37. (23.) — THE GENERAL MEASIJEEMENT OF EUEOPE. 

Having thus made the circuit of Europe, we must now 
give the complete measurement of it, in order that those 
who wish to be acquainted with this subject may not feel 
themselves at a loss. Artemidorus and Isidorus liave given 
its length, from the Tanais to Gades, as 8214 miles. Poly- 
bius in his writings has stated the breadth of Europe, in a 
line from Italy to the ocean, to be 1150 miles. But, even 
in his day, its magnitude was but little known. The distance 
of Italy, as we have previously^ stated, as far as the Alps, is 
1120 miles, from which, through Lugdunum to the British 
port of the Morini^, the direction which Polybius seems to 

^ If Grades was not the same as Tartessus (probably the Tarshish 
of Scripture), its exact locaUty is a question in dispute. Most ancient 
vrriters place it at the mouth of the river Ba;tis, while others identity 
it, and perhaps with more pi-obabihty, with the city of Carteia, on 
Mount Calpe, the Rock of Gibrahar. The whole country west of 
Gibraltar was called Tartessis. See B. iii. c. 3. 

2 Or more properly ' Agadir,' or ' Hagadir.' It probably received 
this name, meaning a ' hedge,' or ' bulwark,' Irom the fact of its beuig 
the chief Phoenician colony outside of the Pillars of Ilercules. 

3 Of Erythrsea, or Erjtheia. The monster Genon, or Geryones, fabled 
to have had three bodies, hved in the fabulous Island of Erytheia, or the 
"Red Isle," so called because it lay under the rays of the setting sun in 
the west. It was originally said to be situate oW the coast of Epirub, 
but was afterwards identified either with Gades or the Balearic islandb, 
and was at all times beheved to be ui the distant west. Gerjon was 
said to have been the son of Chrysaor, the wealthy king of Iberia.

1^ Ateius, surnamed Prcetextatus, and also Philologus, which last 
name he assumed to indicate his learning, was born at Athens, and was 
one of the most celebrated grammarians of Rome, in the latter part of 
the first century B.C. He was originally a freedman of the jurist Ateius 
Capito, by whom he was described as " a rhetorician among grammarians, 
and a grammarian among rhetoricians." He was on terms of intimacy 
with Sallust the historian, and Asinius PoUio. It is supposed that he 
assisted Sallust in the compilation of liis history ; but to what extent is 
not known. But few of his numerous commentaries were extant even 
in the time of Suetonius. 

1" A native of Megalopolis in Arcadia, born about B.C. 204. He was 
trained probably in political knowledge and the mihtary art imder 
Philopcemen, and was sent as a prisoner to Eome, vfiilx others, to 
answer the charge of not aiding the Romans in their war against 
Perseus. Here, by great good fortune, he secured the finendship of 
Scipio Africanus, with whom he was present at the destruction of Car- 
thage. His history is one of the most valuable works that has come 
down to us from antiquity.

frequently quoted by ancient writers. Strabo also says that he com- 
posed poetry. ^ See end of B. ii. 

7 Of Cuma?, or Cyma?, in Ionia. He flourished about B.C. 108. He 
studied imdcr Isocrates, and gained considerable fame as a historian. 
Though anxious to disclose the truth, he has been accused of sometimes 
forcing his authorities to suit his own views. Of his historj' of Greece, 
and his essays on various subjects, a few fragments only survive. 

8 A grammarian of MaUus, in CiUcia. He lived in the time of Ptolemy 
PhUopater, and I'csided at Pergamus, under the patronage of Eumenes II. 
and Attains II. In his grammatical system he made a strong distinc- 
tion between criticism and grammar, the latter of whidi seienees he re- 
garded as quite subordinate to the former. Of his learned commentaries 
on the Ihad and the Odyssey, only a few fragments have come down 
to us. • See end of B. ii. 

^*^ Of Cyrene, an Alexandrian grammarian and poet. He flourished 
at Alexandria, whither Ptolemy Pliiladelphus had invited him to a place 
in the Museum. Of liis Hymns and Epigrams many are still extant. His

1 Of Tauromenium, in Sicily ; a celebrated historian, who flourished 
about the year B.C. 300. He was banished from SicHy by Agathocles, 
and passed his exile at Athens. He composed a History of Sicily, 
from the earUest times to the year B.C. 264. The value of his history 
has been gravely attacked by Polybius ; but there is httle doubt that it 
possessed very considerable merit. Of tliis, and other works of Timseus, 
only a few fragments survive. 

2 A Greek historian ; a native of Lesbos. When he lived is unknown. 
Dionysius, of Hahcarnassus, has borrowed from him a portion of his ac- 
count of the Pelasgians. He is said to have been the author of the notion 
that the Tyrrhenians, in consequence of then* wanderings after they left 
their original settlement, got the name of irekapyoi, or " storks." He is 
supposed to have written a History of Lesbos, as also a work called 
" Historical Paradoxes." ^ gee end of B. iii. ■* See end of B. iii. 

■ ^ Of tliis author nothing whatever seems to be known. 
^ Of Miletus, bom B.C. 610. One of the earhest philosophers of the 
Ionian school, and said to be a pupil of Thales. Unless Pherecydes of 
Scyros be an exception, he was the first author of a philosophical treatise 
in Grreek prose. Other writmgs are ascribed to lum by Suidas ; but, no 
doubt, on insufficient grounds. Of his treatise, wliich seems to have 
contained summary statements of his opinions, no remains exist. 

7 Of this writer nothing whatever is known, beyond the fact that, 
from his name, he seems to have been a native of MaUus, in Cihcia. 

8 It seems impossible to say wliich, out of the vast number of the 
authors who bore this name, is the one here referred to. It is not im- 
probable that Dionysius of Chalcis, a Greek liistorian who hved before 
the Cln-istian era, is meant. He wi'ote a work on the Foundation of 
Towns, in five books, which is frequ^ently referred to by the ancients. It 
is not probable that the author of the Periegesis, or " Description of the 
World," is referred to, as that book bears internal marks of having been 
compiled in the third or fom'th century of the Christian era. 

8 Of Miletus. He was the author of the " Milesiaca," a romance of 
licentious character, which was translated into Latin by L. Cornehus 
Sisenna. He is looked upon as the inventor of the Greek romance, and 
the title of his work is supposed to have given rise to the term Milesian^ 
as apphed to works of fiction. 

^^ A Greek author, of whom nothing is known, except that PHny, 
and after him SoUnus, refer to him as the authority for the statement 
that Euboea was oinginaUy called Chalcis, from the fact of (xaXwds) copper 
being first discovered there. 

^^ Probably Menfcchmus of Sicyon, who wrote a book on Actors, a 
History of Alexander the Great, and a book on Sicyon. Suidas says

of Aristotle. His works upon philosophy, history, mathematics, and 
other subjects, were veiy numerous ; but, imfortmiately, they are nearly 
all of them lost. He wrote a Treatise upon Islands, and another upon 
the Origin of Cities. 

■* A geographical writer, of whom nothing further is known.

" Attic Bee." His principal works arc the Anabasis, or the History of 
the Expedition of the younger Cyrus and the Retreat of the Ten Thou-

refers to either of those authors. 

' A Greek historian, quoted by Dionysius of Hahcamassus. If the

part dwells only m fortresses'^. 

(1.) On our entrance into Africa, we find the two Mauri- 
tanias, which, until the time of Gains C^sar^ the son 
ol Grermamcus, were kingdoms ; but, suff^ering under his 
cruelty, they were divided into two provinces. The extreme 
promontory of Africa, which projects into the ocean, is caUed 
Ampelusia^ by the Greeks. There were formerly two towns 
Lissa and C&lt;)tte^ beyond the Pillars of Hercules; but, at 
the present day, we only find that of Tingi«, which was for-

Ptolemy and Strabo Cote, or Coteis. Phny means «' extreme," with re-

merly founded by Antaeus, and afterwards received the name 
of Traducta Julia \ from Claudius Caesar, when he esta^ 
blished a colony there. It is thirty miles distant from 
Belong a town of Baetica, where the passage across is the 
shortest. At a distance of twenty-five miles from Tingi, 
upon the shores of the ocean^, we come to Julia Cou- 
stautia Zilis"*, a colony of Augustus. This place is exempt 
from all subjection to the kings of Mauritania, and is in- 
cluded in the legal jurisdiction of Baetica. Thirty-two 
miles distant from Julia Constantia is Lixos*, which was v 
made a Eoman colony by Claudius Caesar, and which has 
been the subject of such wondrous fables, related by the 
Krriters of antiquity. At this place, according to the 
story, was the palace of Antaeus ; this was the scene of his 
combat with Hercules, and here were the gardens of the 
Hesperides^. An arm of the sea flows into the land here, 

its name from Tinge, the wife of Antseus, the giant, who was slain by 
Hercules. His tomb, which formed a hill, in the shape of a man. 
stretched out at full length, was shown near the town of Tingis to a 
late period. It was also beheved, that whenever a portion of the earth 
covering the body was taken away, it rained until the hole was filled up 
again. Sertorius is said to have dug away a portion of the hiU ; but, on 
discovering a skeleton sixty cubits in length, he was struck with horror, 
and had it immediately covered again. Procopius says, that the fortress 
of this place was built by the Canaanites, who were driven by the Jews 
out of Palestine. 

^ It has been supposed by Salmasius and others of the learned, that 
Pliny by mistake here attributes to Claudius the formation of a colony 
which was really estabhshed by either Julius Csesar or Augustus. It is 
more probable, however, that Claudius, at a later period, ordered it to 
be called " Traducta Juha," or " the removed Colony of Julia," in re- 
membrance of a colony having proceeded thence to Spain in the time of 
Juhus Caesar. Claudius liimself, as stated in the text, estabhshed a 
colony here. 

2 Its ruins are to be seen at Belonia, or Bolonia, tliree Spanish miles 
west of the modem Tarifa. 

3 At tliis point Phny begins his description of the western side of 
Africa. 

* Now Arzilla, in the territory of Fez. Ptolemy places it at tlie mouth 
of the river Zileia. It is also mentioned by Strabo and Antoniims. 

5 Now El Araiche, or Larache, on the river Lucos. 

^ Mentioned again in B. ix. c. 4 and c. 5 of the present Book, where 
Phny speaks of them as situate elsewhere. The story of Antaeus is 
further enlarged upon by Solinus, B. xxiv. j Lucan, B. iv. 1. 589, et seq. ; 
and Martian us Capella, B. vi.

witli a serpentine channel, and, from the nature of the 
locality, this is interpreted at the present day as having been 
what was really represented by the story of the di'agon 
keeping guard there. This tract of water surrounds an 
island, the only spot which is never overflowed by the tides 
of the sea, although not quite so elevated as the rest of the 
land in its vicinity. Upon this island, also, there is still in 
existence the altar of Hercules ; but of the grove that bore 
the golden fruit, there are no traces left, beyond some wild 
olive-trees. People will certainly be the less siu'prised at 
the marvellous falsehoods of the Grreeks, which have been 
related about this place and the river Lixos\ when they re- 
flect that some of our own^ countrymen as well, and that 
too very recently, have related stories in reference to them 
hardly less monstrous ; how that this city is remarkable for 
its power and extensive influence, and how tliat it is even 
greater than Grreat Carthage ever was ; how, too, that it is 
situate just opposite to Carthage, and at an almost im- 
measurable distance from Tingi, together with other details 
of a similr.r nature, all of which Cornelius Nepos has believed 
with the most insatiate credulity^. 

In the interior, at a distance of forty miles from Lixos, is 
Babba\ surnamed Julia Campestris, another colony of Augus- 
tus ; and, at a distance of seventy-five, a third, called Banasa^, 

^ Now the Lucos. 

2 Hardoimi is of opinion, that he here has a hit at G-abinius, a Roman 
author, who, in liis Annals of Mauritania, as we learn fi'om Strabo 
(B. xvii.), inserted numerous marvellous and incredible stories. 

2 Wlien we find Pliny accusing other wTiters of credulity, we are 
strongly reminded of the proverb, ' Clodius accusat moechos.' 

^ Or the " Juhan Colony on the Plains." Marcus suggests that the 
word Bahha may possibly have been derived from the Hebrew or Phbe- 
nician word heab or heaha, " situate in a thick forest." Poinsinet takes 
Babba to be the Beni-Tuedi of modem times. D'AnviUe thinks that it 
is Naranja. 

^ There is considerable difficulty about the site of Banasa. Moletius 
tlvinks that it is the modern Fanfara, or Pefenfia as Marmol calls it. 
D'AnviUe suggests that it may be Old Mahmora, on the coast ; but, on 
the other hand, Ptolemy places it among the inland cities, assigning to 
it a longitude at some distance from the sea. Phny also appears to 
make it inland, and makes its distance from Lixos seventy-five miles, 
wliile he makes the mouth of the Subvu' to be fifty miles from the 
aame place.

"witli the surname of Yalentia. At a distance of tliii-ty-five 
miles from this last is the town of A'olubilis, which is just 
that distance also from botli^ seas. On the coast, at a 
distance of fifty miles from Lixos, is the river Subur"-, which 
flows past the colony of Banasa, a fine river, and available 
for the pui'poses of navigation. At the same distance from 
it is the city of Sala^, situate on a river which bears the 
same name, a place which stands upon the very verge of the 
desert, and though infested by troops of elephants, is much 
more exposed to the attacks of the nation of the Autololes, 
through whose country lies the road to Mount Atlas, the 
most fabulous** locality even in Africa. 

It is from the midst of the sands, according to the story, 
that this mountain^ raises its head to the heavens ; rugged 
and craggy on the side which looks toward the shores of the 
ocean to which it has given its name, while on that which 
faces tlie interior of Africa it is shaded by dense groves 
of trees, and refreshed by flowing streams ; fruits of all 
kinds springing up there spontaneously to such an extent, 
as to more than satiate every possible desire. Throughout 
the daytime, no inhabitant is to be seen ; all is silent, like 
that dreadfid stillness which reigns in the desert. A religious 
horror steals imperceptibly over the feelings of those who 
approach, and they feel themselves smitten with awe at the 
stupendous aspect of its summit, which reaches beyond the 
clouds, and well nigh approaches the very orb of tlie moon. 
At night, they say, it gleams with fires innumerable lighted 

^ From both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. According to 
Poinsinet, TolubQis was the synonym of the African name Fez^ signify- 
ing a ' band,' or ' swathe.' Mannert conjectures that it is the same as 
the modem Wahli, or QuaUli. D'AnvLlle calls it Guulih, and says that 
there are some remains of antiquity there. 

2 The modern Subu, or Sebou. D' Anville is of opinion that this river 
has changed a part of its course since the time of PUny. 

^ Most probably the modem Sallee stands on its site. 

^ Not in reference to the fact of its existence, but the wonderful stories 
which were told respecting it. 

^ Like others of the ancient writers, Pliny falls into the error of con- 
sidering Atlas, not as an extensive chain of mountains, but as an isolated 
mountain, surroimded by sands. With reference to its lieight, the whole 
range declines considerably from west to east ; tlie liighcst summits in 
Morocco reaching near 13,000 feet, m Tunis not 5000.

up ; it is tlien the scene of tlie gambols of the JEgipans' and 
the Satyr crew, while it re-echoes with the notes of the flute 
and the pipe, and the clash of drums and cymbals. All this 
is what authors of high character have stated, in addition to 
the labours which Hercules and Perseus there experienced. 
The space which intervenes before you arrive at this moun- 
tain is immense, and the country quite unknowTi. 

There formerly existed some Commentaries vtritten by 
Hanno^, a Carthaginian general, who was commanded, in 
the most flourishing times of the Punic state, to explore 
the sea-coast of Africa. The greater part of the Greek 
and E/oman writers have followed him, and have related, 
among other fabulous stories, that many cities there were 
founded by him, of which no remembrance, nor yet the 
slightest vestige, now exists. 

While Scipio JEmilianus held the command in Sicily, 
Polybius the historian received a fleet from him for the 
purpose of proceeding on a voyage of discovery in this part 
of the world. He relates, that beyond^ Mount Atlas, pro- 

^ Or " Groat-Pens ;" probably another name for the Fauni, or Fauns. 
More usually, there is but one -^gipan mentioned, — the son, according 
to Hyginus, of Zeus or Jupiter, and a goat, — or of Zeus and .^ga, the 
wife of Pan. As a foundation for one part of the stories here men- 
tioned, Brotier suggests the fact, that as the Kabyles, or moimtain tribes, 
are in the habit of retiring to their dweUings and reposing during the 
heat of the day, it would not, consequently, be improbable that they 
would devote the night to their amusements, Hghting up fires, and 
dancing to the music of drums and cymbals. 

2 Under his name we still possess a " Periplus," or account of a 
voyage round a part of Libya. The work was originally written iu 
Punic, but what has come down to us is a Greek translation. We fail, 
however, to discover any means by wliich to identify him with any one 
of the many Carthaginians of the same name. Some writers caH 
him king, and others dux, or imperaior of the Carthaginians ; from 
which wo may infer, that he held the office of suffeies. This expedition 
has by some been placed as far back as the time of the Trojan war, or of 
Hesiod, while others again place it as late as the reign of Agathocles. 
Falconer, Bougainville, and Gail, place the time of Hanno at about 
B.C. 570, while other critics identify him with Hanno, the father or son 
of Ilamilcar, who was killed at Himera, B.C. 480. Pliny often makes 
mention of him ; more particularly see B. viii. c. 21. 

' 2 M. Gossehn thinks that tlie spot here indicated was at the south- 
western extremity of the Atlas range, and upon the northern frontier of 
the Desert of Zahara.

ceeding in a westerly direction, there are forests filled with 
wild beasts, peculiar to the soil of Africa, as far as the 
river Anatis\ a distance of 485 miles, Lixos being distant 
from it 205 miles. Agrippa says, that Lixos is distant from 
the Straits of Gades 112 miles. After it we come to a 
gulf which is called the Gulf of Saguti^, a town situate on 
the Promontory of Mulelacha^, the rivers Subnr and Salat*, 
and the port of Eutubis^, distant from Lixos 213 miles 
We then come to the Promontory of the Sun^, the port of 
Bisardir", the Gietulian Autololes, the river Cosenus^, the 
nations of the Selatiti and the Masati, the river Masathat^, 
and the river Darat'^, in which crocodiles are found. After 
this we come to a large gulf, G16^^ miles in extent, which is 
enclosed by a promontory of Mount Barce^', which runs 
out in a westerly direction, and is called Surreutium''. 
Next comes the river Salsus^^, beyond which lie the Ethio- 
pian Perorsi, at the back of whom are the Pharusii'^, who 

^ Supposed by some geographers to be the same as tliat now called 
the Ommirabili, or the Om-Rabya. This is also thouglit by some to have 
been the same nver as is called by Pliny, in p. 381, by the name of 
Asana ; but the distances do not agree. 

2 Supposed by Gossehn to be the present bay of Al-cazar, on the 
African coast, m the Straits of Cadiz ; though Hardouin takes it to be 
the koXtto? f^fiTToptKO'?, or " Gulf of Commerce," of Strabo and Ptolemy. 
By first quoting from one, and then at a tangent from another, Pliny 
involves this subject in almost inextricable confusion. 

3 Probably the place called Thymiaterion in the Periplus of TTanno. 

* The present Subu, and the river probably of Sallce, previously 
mentioned. 

* The modem Mazagan, according to Gosselin. 

^ Cape Cantin, according to Gosseliji ; Cape Blanco, according to 
Marcus. 7 Probably the Safi, Af^afi, or SafTee of the present day. 

8 The river Tensift, which runs close to the city of Morocco, in the 
interior. ^ The river Mogador of the present day. 

^0 The modem river Sus, or Sous. 

" The learned Gosselin has aptly remarked, that this cannot be other 
than an error, and that "ninety-six" is the correct reading, the Gulf of 
Sainte-Croix being evidimtly the one here referred to.

are bordered upon by the Gsetulian Darse^ lying in tbe 
interior. Upon the coast again, we find the Ethiopian 
Daratit^e, and the river Bambotus^, teeming with croco- 
diles and hippopotami. From this river there is a con- 
tinuous range^ of mountains till we come to the one which 
is kno^^'n by the name of Theon Ochema"*, from which to the 
Hesperian Promontory^ is a voyage of ten days and nights ; 
and in the middle of this space he*' has placed Mount Atlas, 
which by all other writers has been stated to be in the ex- 
treme parts of Mauritania. 

The Eoinan arms, for the first time, pursued their con- 
quests into Mauritania, under the Emperor Claudius, when 
the freedman -^demon took up arms to avenge the death of 
King Ptolemy^, who had been put to death by Caius Caesar ; 

1 Marcus believes these to have been the ancestors of the present race 
of the Touaricks, while the MelanogeetuU were the progenitors of the 
Tibbos, of a darker complexion, and more nearly resembling the negroes 
in bodily conformation. 

2 Supposed by Gosselin to be the present river Nun, or Non. Ac- 
cordhig to Bochart, tlais river received its name from the Hebrew or 
Phoenician word behemoth or hamoth, the name by which Job (xl. 15) 
calls the crocodile [or rather the hippopotamus]. Bochart, however, 
with Mannert, BougamviUe, De Rennet, and De Heeren, is of opinion, 
that by this name the modern river Senegal is meant. Marcus is of 
opinion that it is either the Non or the modern Sobi. 

3 Marcus here observes, that from Cape Alfach, below Cape Non, 
there are no mountains, but continual wastes of sand, bordering on the 
sea-shore. Indeed there is no headland, of any considerable height, 
between Cape Sobi and Cape Bajador. 

^ " The Chariot of the Gods." Marcus is of opinion that it is the 
modem Cape Verde ; while, on the other hand, Gosselin takes it to be 
Cape Non. Brotier calls it Cape Ledo. 

^ In B. vi. c. 36, Phny speaks of tliis promontory as the " Hesperian 
Horn," and says that it is but four days' sail from the Theon Ochema. 
Brotier identifies this promontory with the modern Cape Roxo. Marcus 
is of opinion that it was the same as Cape N6n ; but there is considerable 
difficulty in determining its identity. 

® Alluding to Polybius ; though, according to the reading which SiUig 
has adopted a few hnes previously, Agrippa is the last author mentioned. 
Phny has here mistaken the meaning of Polybius, who has placed Atlas 
midway between Carthage, from which he had set out, and the Pro* 
montory of Theon Ochema, which he reached. 

7 Ptolemy the son of Juba II. and Cleopatra, was summoned to Rome 
in the year a.d. 40, by Cahgula, and shortly after put to death by him, 
his riches having excited the emperor's cupidity. Previously to this, he

and it is a well-known fact, that on the flight of the bar- 
barians our troops reached Mount Atlas. It became a boast, 
not only among men of considar rank, and generals selected 
from the senate, who at that time held tlie command, but 
among persons of equestrian rank as well, who after that 
period held the government there, that they had penetrated as 
far as Mount Atlas. There are, as we have already stated, five 
Eoman colonies in this province ; and it may very possibly ap- 
pear, if we listen only to what report says, that this mountain 
is easily accessible. Upon trial, however, it has been pretty 
generally shown, that all such statements are utterly fal- 
lacious ; and it is too true, that men in high station, when 
they are disinclined to take the trouble of inquiring into 
the truth, through a feeling of shame at their ignorance arc 
not averse to be guilty of falsehood ; and never is implicit 
credence more readily given, than when a falsehood is sup- 
ported by the authority of some personage of high considera- 
tion. Por my own part, I am far less surprised that there are 
still some facts remaining undiscovered by men of the eques- 
trian order, and even those among them who have attained 
senatorial rank, than that the love of luxury has left any- 
thing unascertained ; the impulse of which must be great 
indeed, and most powerfully felt, when tlie very forests are 
ransacked for their ivory and citron-wood \ and all tlie rocks 
of Gaetulia are searched for the nuirex and the purple. 

From the natives, liowever, we learn, that on the coast, at 
a distance of 150 miles from the Salat, the river Asana- pre- 
sents itself; its waters are salt, but it is remarkable for its 
fine harbour. They also say that after this we come to a 
river known by the name of Fut^, and then, after crossing 
another called Yior wliich lies on tlie road, at a distance of 
200 miles we arrive at Dyris'*, such being the name which in 
their language they give to Mount Atlas. According to their 

liad boon on terms of strict aUiance with the Roman peo]ilc, who had 
decreed him a ioga picta and a sceptre, as a mark of their friendship.

laying of the tables used by the Roman nobility. See B. xiii. c. 23.

story there are still existing in its vicinity many vestiges which 
tend to prove that the locality was once inhabited ; such as 
the remains of vineyards and plantations of palm-trees. 

Suetonius Paulinns\ whom we have seen Consul in our 
own time, w^as the first Eoman general who advanced a 
distance of some miles beyond Mount Atlas. He has given 
us the same information as we have received from other 
sources with reference to the extraordinary height of this 
mountain, and at the same time he has stated that all the 
lower parts about the foot of it are covered with dense 
and lofty forests composed of trees of species hitherto un- 
known. The height of these trees, he says, is remarkable ; 
the trunks are without knots, and of a smooth and glossy 
surface ; the foliage is like that of the cypress, and besides 
sending forth a powerful odour, they are covered with a 
flossy Sovm, from which, by the aid of art, a fine cloth might 
easily be manufactured, similar to the textures made from the 
produce of the silk-worm. He informs us that the summit 
of this mountain is covered with snow^ even in summer, and 
says that having arrived there after a march of ten days, he 
proceeded some distance beyond it as far as a river which 
bears the name of Ger^; the road being through deserts 
covered with a black sand^, from which rocks that bore the 
appearance of having been exposed to the action of fire, pro- 
jected every here and there ; localities rendered quite uninha- 
bitable by the intensity of the heat, as he himself experienced, 

1 The same general who afterwards conquered the Britons under Boa- 
dicea or Bonduca. While Propreetor in Mauritania under the Emperor 
Claudius, in the year A.D. 42, he defeated the Mauri who had risen in 
revolt, and advanced, as PHny here states, as far as Mount Atlas. It is 
not known from what point Paulinus made his advance towards the Atlas 
range. Mannert and Marcus are of opinion that he set out from Sala, 
the modern Sallee, while LatreUle, Malte Brun, and Walkenaer think 
that his point of departure was the mouth of the river Lixos. Sala was 
the most southerly town on the western coast of Africa that in the time 
of Pliny had submitted to the Eoman arms. 

2 Some of the editions read ' Niger' here. Marcus suggests that that 
river may have been called 'Niger' by the Phoenician or Punic colonists 
of the western Mauritania, and 'Ger' or' Grar' in another quarter. The 
same writer also suggests that the SigHmessa was the river to which 
Paulinus penetrated on his march beyond Atlas. 

' The SigUraessa, according to Marmol, flows betAveen several moun- 
tains which appear to be of a blackish hue. 



Chap. 1.] ACCOUNT OF COriTTEIES, ETC. 883 

although it was in the winter season that he visited them. 
We also learn from the same source that the people who 
inhabit the adjoining forests, whicli are full of all kinds of 
elephants, wild beasts, and serpents, have the name of Ca- 
narii ; from the circumstance that they partake of their food 
in common with the canine race, and share with it the 
entrails of wild beasts. 

It is a well-known fact, that adjoining to these localities 
is a nation of Ethiopians, which bears the name of Perorsi. 
Juba, the father of Ptolemy, who was the first king^ wlio 
reigned over both the ]Mauritanias,and who has been rendered 
even more famous by the brilliancy of his learning than by 
his kingly rank, has given us similar information relative to 
Mount Atlas, and states that a certain herb grows there, 
which has received the name of ' euphorbia'^ from tliat of his 
physician, who was the first to discover it. Juba extols with 
wondrous praises the milky juice of this plant as tending to 
improve the sight, and acting as a specific against the bites 
of serpents and all kinds of poison ; and to this subject alone 
he has devoted an entu-e book. Thus much, if indeed not 
more than enough, about Mount Atlas. 

(2.) The province of Tingitana is 170 miles iii leugth'. 
Of the nations in this province the principal one was for- 
merly that of the Mauri'*, who have given to it the name of 
Mauritania, and have been by many writers called the 
Maurusii^. This nation has been greatly weakened by the 
disasters of war, and is now dwindled down to a few fami- 
lies only^. Next to the Mauri was formerly the nation of 

^ Bocchu9 however, the kinsman of Maesinissa, had previously for 
some time reigned over both the Mauritanias, couaifiting of Mauritania 
Tuigitana and Maui'itania Cajf»aEiana.

3 Extending from the sea to the river Moluga, now called the Molucha 
and Moloeliath, or Malva and Malvana. 

* From whom the Moors of the present day take their name. IVfarrus 
observes liere, that tliough Phny di.slinguishes the Mauri from the GivtuU, 
they essctitiiilly belonged to the same raee and sjioke tlie same hmguage, 
the so-ealli'd I&gt;erber, and its diak-ets, the SeheUou and tlie 8i-lu)viah. 

* ' Maurusii' was the On-ek name, ' ^hiuri' l\w Latin, for this peo])le. 
Mareus suggests tliat Mauri was a synonym only for the Greek word 
nomades, ' wanderers,'

Paulinus, the Mauri had retreated uito the interior and taken refuge in

the Massaesyli^ ; they in a similar manner have become ex- 
tinct. Their country is now occupied by the Gsetulian na- 
tions^, the Baniura3^, the Autololes^ by far the most power- 
ful people among them all, and the Vesuni, who formerly 
were a part of the Autololes, but have now separated from 
them, and, turning their steps towards the Ethiopians®, 
have formed a distinct nation of their own. This province, 
in the mountainous district which lies on its eastern side, 
produces elephants, as also on the heights of Mount Abyla^ 
and among those elevations which, from the similarity of 
their height, are called the Seven Brothers'^. Joining the 
range of Abyla these mountains overlook the Straits of Gades. 
At the extremity of this chain begin the shores of the in- 
land sea **, and we come to the Tamuda^, a na\igable stream, 
with the site of a former town of the same name, and then 

the deserts of Zaliara, whence they had again emerged in the time of the 
geographer Ptolemy. 

^ From the time of the second Punic War this people had remained 
in undisputed possession of the country situate between the rivers Mo- 
lochath or Moluga and Ampsaga, which formed the Csesarian Maurita- 
nia. Ptolemy speaks of finding some remains of them at Siga, a town 
situate on a river of the same name, and at which King Syphax had 
formerly resided. 

2 Wliile Pomponius Mela does not make any difference between the 
Mauri and the Gsetuli, Pliny here speaks of them as being essentially 
different.

* The Autololes or, as Ptolemy calls them, the Autololae, dwelt, it is 
supposed, on the western coast of Africa, between Cape Cantin and Cape 
Ger. Their city of Autolala or Autolalse is one of Ptolemy's points of 
astronomical observation, having the longest day thirteen hours and a half, 
being distant three hours and a half west of Alexandria, and having the 
sun vertical once a year, at the time of the winter solstice. Keichard 
takes it for the modern Agulon or Aquilon, 

^ The iEthiopian Daratitse, Marcus says. ^ The present Ceuta. 

7 They were so called from the cii'cumstance, Marcus says, of their 
peaks being so numerous, and so strongly resembling each other. They 
are now called, according to D' Anville, ' Gebel Mousa,' which means " the 
Mountain of Apes," an animal by which they are now much frequented, 
instead of by elephants as in Pliny's time. ^ Or Mediterranean.

for a long time retained the names of their respective kings, 
the further Mauritania being called the "land of Bogud%" 
Avhile that which is now called Ciesariensis was called the 
" country of Bocchus." After passing Siga we come to the 
haven called "Portus Magnus^" from its great extent, with a 
town whose people enjoy the rights of lioman citizens, and 
then the river Mulucha^, Avhieh served as the limit between 
the territory of Bocchus and that of the Masssesyli. Next 
to this is Quiza Xenitana'", a town founded by strangers, 
and Arsenaria", a place with the ancient Latin rights, three 
miles distant from the sea. "We then come to Cartenna^-, a

Csesarea^, but formerly known by the name of lol; this 
place was the residence of King Juba, and received the 
rights of a colony from the now deified Emperor Claudius. 
Oppidum Novum^ is the next place ; a colony of veterans 
was established here by command of the same emperor. 
Next to it is Tipasa^, which has received Latin rights, as 
also Icasium", which has been presented by the Emperor 
Vespasianus with similar rights ; Eusconise^, a colony 
founded by Augustus ; E-usucurium^, honoured by Clau-

3 According to Dupinet and Mannert, the modem Tenez occupies its 
site, Zershell according to Hardoiiin and Shaw, Vacur according to 
D'AnviUe and Ansart, and Algiers according to others. It is suggested 
by Marcus that the name lol is derived from the Arabic verb galla, " to 
be noble" or " famous." There is no doubt that the magnificent ruins 
at Zershell are those of lol, and that its name is an abbreviation of 
Csesarea lol. * Or New Town. 

^ Scylax calls it Thapsus ; Ammianus MarceUinus, Tiposa. According 
to Mannert it was situate in the vicinity of the modern Damas. 

6 Or Icosium. It has been identified by inscriptions discovered - by 
the French as standing on the same site as the modern Algiers. D' Anville, 
Mannert and others identify it with SchercheU or Zershell, thus placing 
it too far west. Mannert was evidently misled by an error in the Anto- 
nine Itinerary, whereby aU the places along this coast are, for a con- 
siderable distance, thrown too far to the west ; the researches however 
which followed the French conquest of the country have revealed inscrip- 
tions which completely set the question at rest. 

7 According to Mannert, this was situate on the modern Cape Arbatel. 
Marcus thinks that the Hebrew ros, or Arab ras, "a rock," enters into 
tiie composition of the word.

CHAP. 2. (3.)— NUMIDIA. 

At the river Ampsaga Xumidia begins, a coimtry rendered 
iHustrious by tlie fame of i\rasinissa. By the Greeks this 
region was called Metagonitis^'^ ; and the :^umidians received 
the name of " A^omades " from their frequent changes of pas- 
turage ; upon which occasions they were accustomed to carry ^^ 
their ma^alia, or in other words, their houses, upon waggons. 

1 Destroyed, a&lt;;cording to Hardouin, and probably by the incursions 
Ot tlie sea. At the mouth of the Ampsaga (now called the W'ad-El-Kebh- 
or Sufjunar and higher up the Wadi Koumel) there is situate a smaU 
sea-port called Marsa Zeitoun. 

2 Near the present Mazuaa, according to Mannert. 

3 The modem 13urgh, accordmg to D'Anville and Mannert, but more 
probably considerably to the east of that place.

* Marcus suggests that tliis is the Clunalaphof Ptolemy, and probably 
the modern Schellif. ^ 

« The same that is caUed Sayis by Ptolemy, who places Icosium on 
its banks. 

7 Ey Mela called the Vabar. Marcus supposes it to be the same as 
the modem Griffer. 

8 By Ptolemy caUed the Sisar ; the Ajebbi of modem geographers 
which falls mto the Mechterranean, near tlu- city of Budja. ' 

^ Brotier says tliat this reading is incorrect, and that 222 is the pro- 
per one, tliat being the true distance between the river Ampsaga or ^\^ad- 
el-Kebu- and the city of Cscsarea, the modern Zershell. " 

10 It was not only Nuniidia that bore this name, but all Die northern 
coast of Africa from the frontiers of the kingdom of Cartilage near IJipi)o 
Keguis to the Colunms of Hercules. It was thus called from the (J reek 
metaffonos, a "descendant" or "successor;" as tlie Carthaginians 
estabhshed a number of small towns and villages on the coa^^t .whieli 
were thus posterior in their origin to the large cities ah-eady founded 
there. *^

usage, carrying their houses from pasture to pasture on wagi^c^ns.

The towns of tliis country are Ciillu^ and Eusicade' ; and 
at a distance of forty-eiglit miles from the latter, in the in- 
terior, is the colony of Cirta^, surnamed " of the Sitiani ;" 
still more inland is another colony called Sicca^, with 
the free town of Bulla Eegia^ . On the coast are Tacatua^, 
Hippo Regius'', the river Armua^, and the town of Tabraca^, 
•\^dth the rights of E-oman citizens. The river Tusca^° forms 
the boundary of ISTumidia. This country produces nothing 
remarkable except its marble ^^ and wild beasts.

Beyond the river Tusca begins the region of Zeugitana^^, 
and that part which properly bears the name of Africa^^. 

^ Now Chollum or CoUo. 

2 The modern Sgigada or Stora, according to Mannert, D'Anville, 
and Shaw. 

3 The modern Constantina occupies its site. Numerous remains of 
the ancient town are still discovered. Sitius was an officer who served 
under Csesar, and obtained a grant of this place after the defeat of Juba. 

^ Called Urbs, or Kaff, according to D'Anville and Shaw j the latter 
of whom found an inscription there with the words Ordo Siccensiv/m. 

5 Or ' Koyal Bulla' ; which epithet shows that it was either a residence 
or a foundation of the kings of Numidia, and distinguishes it from a small 
place called Bulla Mensa, south of Carthage. Bulla Kegia was fom* days' 
journey south-west of Cartilage, on a tributary of the river Bagrada, the 
vaUey of wliich is still called Wad-el-Boul. This place was one of the 
points of Ptolemy's recorded astronomical observations, having its longest 
day fom'teen hours and one-eighth, and being distant from Alexandria 
two hours to the west. 

^ The modern Tamseh, according to Shaw and Mannert, and Tagodet, 
according to D'Anville. 

7 Its rums are south of the modern Bona. It received the name of 
Regius or ' Royal' from being the residence of the Numidian kings. It 
was also famed as being the see of St. Augustine, It was a colony of 
Tyi'c, and stood on the bay now forming the Gulf of Bona. It was one 
of the most flourisliing cities of Africa tiU it was destroyed by the Van- 
dals A.D. 430. 

^ Now the Mafragg, according to Mannert.

"We here find tliree promontories ; the "Wliite Promontory', 
the Promontory of Apollo^, facing Sardinia, and that of 
Mercury^, opposite to Sicily. Projecting into tlie sea these 
headhmds form two gnlfs, the first of which bears the name 
of "Hipponensis" from its proximity to the city called 
Hippo Dirutns"*, a corruption of the Greek name Diarrhy- 
tus, which it has received from the channels made for irriga- 
tion. Adjacent to this place, but at a greater distance from 
the sea-shore, is Theudalis*, a towTi exempt from tribute. 
We then come to the Promontory of Apollo, and upon 
the second gulf, we find Utica^, a place enjoying the rights 
of Eoman citizens, and famous for the death of Cato ; the 
river Bagrada*", the place called Castra CorneKa^, the co- 

one-thii'd of the globe, but also in contradistinction to the proconsular 
province of the Roman empire of the same name, which contained not 
only the province of Zeugitana, but also those of Nmnidia, 13yzacium, 
and Ti'ipohs. 

1 Candidum : now Ras-el-Abiad. 

^ The references to this headland identify it with Cape Farina, or Eas 
Sidi Ali-al-Mekhi, and not, as some have thought, the more westerly Cape 
Zibeeb or Ras Sidi Bou-Shoushe. Shaw however applies the name of 
Zibeeb to the former. ^ ]Nfow Cape Eon, or Kas-Addar. 

■* More properly called Hippo Diarrhytus or Zariliis, a Tyrian colony, 
situate on a large lake wliicli communicated with tiie si-a, and received 
the waters of another lake. Its situation exposed it to frequent inunda- 
tions, whence, as the Greeks used to state, the epithet ciappvros. It 
seems more probable however that this is tlie remnant of some Phoeni- 
cian title, as the ancients were not agreed on the true form of the name, 
and of this imcertahity we have a fiu'ther proof in tlie U'qipo Dirutus 
of our author. 

^ This is placed by Ptolemy to the south-east of Hippo, and near the 
southern extremity of Lake Sisar. 

^ Tliis important city stood on the north part of tlie Carthaginian 
Gulf, west of the mouth of the Bagrada, and twenty-seven Roman miles 
N.W. of Carthage ; but the site oC its ruins at tlie modern Bou-Shater is 
now inland, m consequence of the changes made by tlie Bagrada in the 
coast-line. In the Third Punic war Utica took part with the Romans 
against Carthage, and was rewarded with the greater part of the Car- 
thaginian territory. 

' Kow called the Mejerdah, and though of very inconsiderable- size, the 
chief river of the Cartliaginian territory. The main stream is formed 
by the union of two branches, the southern of whieh, the ancient Bagrada^

Here commences the second division^ of Africa properly 
so called. Those who inhabit Byzacium have the name of 
Libyphcenices^. Byzacium is the name of a district which 
is 250 miles in circumference, and is remarkable for its ex- 
treme fertility, as the ground returns the seed sown by the 
husbandman with interest a hundred-fold ^°. Here are the 



nus the Elder first encamped, on landing in Africa, B.C. 204. Csesar de- 
scribes this spot, in liis description of Cui*io's operations against Utica, 
B. C. b. ii. c. 24, 25. This spot is now called Ghellah. 

J^ This colony was first established by Caius Gracchus, who sent 6000 
settlers to found on the site of Carthage the new city of Junonia. The 
Roman senate afterwards annulled this with the other acts of 
"G-racchus. Under Augustus however the new city of Carthage was 
founded, which, when Strabo wrote, was as prosperous as any city in 
Africa. It was made, in place of Utica, which had favom*ed the Pom- 
peian party, the seat of the proconsul of Old Africa. It stood on the 
peninsula terminated by Ras-Sidi-Bou-Said, Cape Carthage or Car- 
thagena. As Gibbon has remarked, "The place might be unknown if 
some broken arches of an aqueduct did not guide the footsteps of the 
inquisitive traveller." 

2 The original city of Carthage was called ' Carthago Magna' to di- 
stinguish it from New Carthage and Old Carthage, colonies in Spain. 

3 Now Ehades, according to Marcus. 

^ Marcus identifies it with the modern Gurtos. 

5 By the Greeks called ' Aspis.' It derived its Greek and Roman names 
from its site on a hiU of a shield-hke shape. It was built by Agathocles, 
the Sicilian, B.C. 310. In the first Punic war it was the landuig-place 
of Manlius and Regulu.s, whose first action was to take it, B.C. 256. Its 
site is stiU known as Kalebiah, and its ruins are pecuharly interesting. 
The site of Misua is occupied by Sidi-Doud, according to Shaw and 
DAnvHle. 

fi Shaw informs us that an inscription foimd on the spot designates this 
place as a colony, not a free city or town. Its present name is Kurbah.

cium from this last place to Thenge.

the native Libyans or Africans.

we learn that this fertility no longer exists, the fields producing not more 
than eight- or at most twelve-fold.

^ Tlie modem Lempta occupies its site. 

2 Originally a Phoenician colony, older than Carthage. It was the 
capital of Byzacium, and stood within the southern extremity of. the 
Sinus NeapoUtanus or Gulf of Haramamet. Ti-ajan made it a colony, 
under the high-sounding name, as we gather from inscriptions, of Colonia 
Concordia Uljna Trajana Augusta Frugifera Hadrumetana, or, as set 
forth on coins, Colonia Concordia Julia Hadrumetana Pia. The epithet 
Frugifera refers to the fact that it was one of the chief sea-ports for tlie 
corn-producing country of Byzacium. It Avas destroyed by the Vandals, 
but restored by the Emperor Justinian under the name of Justiniana or 
Justinianopohs. The modem Sousa stands on its site ; and but sUght 
traces of the ancient city are to be found. 

3 Situate hi the vicinity of the modern Monastir. 

* Shaw discovered its ruins at the modern town of Demas. 

* Now Taineli, accorduig to D'Anville. This place formed the boun- 
dary between the proconsular provuice of Africa and the territory of tlie 
Numidian king Masinissa and his descendants. 

^ The present Mahometa, accorduig to Marcus, El Malires according 
to D'Anville.

Zeugitana and Byzacium, by a long dyke dra\%ni from Thenjr, due south, 
to the borders of the Great Desert, and thence in a north-westerly direc- 
tion to the river Tiisca.

of their quicksands and the ebb and flow of the sea. Poly- 
bius states the distance from Carthage to the Lesser Syrtis, 
the one which is nearest to it, to be 300 miles. The inlet 
to it he also states to be 100 miles across, and its circum- 
ference 300. There is also a way^ to it by land, to find 
which we must employ the guidance of tlie stars and cross 
deserts which present nothing but sand and serpents. After 
passing these we come to forests filled with vast multitudes 
of wild beasts and elephants, then desert wastes^, and beyond 
them the Graramantes^, distant twelve days' journey from 
the Augylae^, Above the Garamantes was formerly the na- 

Giilf of Cabes, and the Greater the Gulf of Sydra. The country situate 
between the two Syrtes is called Tripoh, formerly Tripohs, a name 
which, according to Sohnus, it owed to its three cities, Sabrata, LeptK, 
and CEa. 

1 Marcus observes with reference to this passage, that both Hardouia 
and Poinsinet have mistaken its meaning. They evidently think that Pliny 
is speakmg here of a route to the Syi-tes leading from the interior of 
Ah'ica, whereas it is pretty clear that he is speaking of the dangers wliich 
attend those who approach it by the line of the sea-coast, as Cato did, on 
his march to Utica, so beautifully described by Lucan in Ms Ninth Book. 
This is no doubt the same route which was taken by the caravans on their 
passage from Lebida, the ancient Leptis, to Berenice m Cyi'enaica. 

2 Those which we find at the middle of the coast bordering upon the 
Greater Syrtis, and which separate the mountains of Eezzan and Atlas 
fr'om Cyrenaica and Barca. 

3 In its widest sense this name is applied to all the Libyan tribes in- 
habiting the Oases on the eastern part of the Great Desert, as the Gsetu- 
lians mhabited its western part, the boundary between the two nations 
being drawn at the soxirces of the Bagrada and the mountain Usargala. 
In the stricter sense however, and in which the term must be here under- 
stood, the name 'Garamantes' denoted the people of Phazania, the mo- 
dem Fezzan, wliich forms by far the largest oasis in the Grand Desert 
of Zahara. 

i^ Augylcc, now Axxjelah, was an oasis in the desert of Barca, in the 
region of Cyrenaica, about 3-^° south of Cyrene. It has been remarked 
that Pliny, here and in the Eighth Chapter of the present Book, in abridg- 
ing the account given by Herodotus of the tribes of Northern Africa, has 
transferred to the Augylse what that author really says of the Nasamones. 
This oasis fonns one of the chief stations on the caravan route from Cairo 
to Fezzan. It is placed by EenneU in 30° 3' North Lat. and 23° 46' East 
Long., 180 miles soxith-east of Barca, ISO west by north of Siwah, the 
ancient Amrnonimn, and 426 east by north of Mourzouk. Later autho- 
rities, however, place the village of Aujelah m 29° 15' North Lat. and 
21° 55' East Long.

tion of the Psylli\ aud above them again the Lake of Lyco- 
medes", surrounded with deserts. The Augyla? themselves 
are situate ahnost midway between Ethiopia which faces 
the west^, and the region which lies between'' the two Syrtes, 
at an equal distance from both. The distance along the 
coast that lies between the two Syrtes is 250 miles. On it 
are found the city of (Ea^, the river Cinyps^, and the country 
of that name, the towns of Neapolis'', Graphara^, and Abroto- 
num**, and the second, surnamed the Greater, Leptis^". 

AVe next come to the Greater Syrtis, 625 miles in cir- 
cumference, and at the entrance 312 miles in width ; next 
after which dwells the nation of the Cisippades. At the 
bottom of this gulf was the coast of the Lotophagi, whom 
some writers have called the Alachroae*\ extending as far as 
the Altars of the Phila^ni^- ; these Altars are formed of heaps 

^ For an account of the Psylli see B. vii. c. 2, They probably dwelt 
in the vicinitr of the luodera Cape Mesurata. 

- Xow Lake Lynxama, according to Marcus. 

3 Marcus observes that in order properly to understand this passage we 
must remember that the ancients considered Africa as terminating north 
of the Equator, and imagined that from the Straits of Hercules the western 
coast of Africa ran, not towards the south-west, but slanted in a south- 
easterly direction to the Straits of Babehnandel. ^ The modem Tripoli. 

' A iiourishing city with a mixed population of Libyans and Sicihans. 
It was at this place that Apuleius made his eloqtrcnt and ingenious de- 
fence against the charge of sorcery brought against liim by his step-sons. 
AccorcUng to some writers the modem Tripoli is built on its site, wliile 
other accoimts make it to have been situate six leagues from that city. 

^ iS'ow called the W'ady-el-Quaham. 

" ]\lannert is of opinion that this was only another name for the city 
of Leptis ^[agna or the "Greater Leptis" here mentioned by Pliny. 
There is little doubt that his supposition is correct. 

** The more common reading is Taplu*a or Taphara. D'Anville iden- 
tifies it witli the to\m of Sfakes. 

^ Scylax identifies it with Neapolis or Leptis, and it is generally looked 
upon as being the same place as Sabrata or OKI Tripoli.

timius Severus. It was almost destroyed by an attack from a Lilnan 
tribe a.d. 366, and its ruin was completed by tlie mvasion of the Arabs. 
Its ruins are considerable. 

11 " Men of sea complexion," is the meaning of this Greek name. Ac- 
cording to Marcus they dwelt bctwivii the (Jreater Leptis niul tlie Lake 
Trit(mis, at the present day called Schihkali-el-Loudeah. For a further

a vast swamp ^ which receives the river Triton^ and from it 
takes its name : by Callimachus it is called Pallantias^, and 
is said by him to be on the nearer side of the Lesser Syrtis ; 
many other writers however place it between the two Syrtes. 
The promontory which bounds the Greater Syrtis has the 
name of Borion"* ; beyond it is the province of Cyrene. 

Africa, from the river Ampsaga to this limit, includes 
516 peoples, who are subject to the Roman sway, of which 
six are colonies ; among them Uthina* and Tuburbi*^, be-

I shall mention, as lying in the interior, those of Assurae'^, 
Abutucum, Aborium, Canopicum^, Cilma^, Simithium, Thu- 
nusidium, Tuburnicum, Tynidrumum, Tibiga, the two towns 
called Ucita, the Greater and tlie Lesser, and Yaga. There 
is also one town with Latin rights, Uzalita by name, and 
one town of tributaries, Castra Cornelia^". The free towns 
are thirty in number, among which we may mention, in the 
interior, those of Acholla^\ Aggarita, Avina, Abzirita, Cano-

related by Pomponius Mela, B. i. c. 7, and Yalerius Maxmius, B. v, c. 6, 
but fi'om the Greek name of the brothers, meaning " lovers of praise," it 
is doubtfid whether the story is not of spurious origin.

by Procopius, there were two columns to be seen in his day, upon wliich 
was wi-itten in the Phoenician language, " We fled from before the robber, 
Joshua the son of Xim." 

* There were two towns of this name in the proconsular province of 
Africa. The first was situate in tlie country of Zeugitana, five days' 
journey west of Carthage, and it was here that Scipio defeated Hannibal. 
The other bore the svumame of Hegia or Royal, from being the fi'equcnt 
residence of the Numidian kings. It lay in 'the interior, and at the pre- 
sent day its site bears the name of 'Zowarin' or 'Zewarin.' 

^ The ruins of Capsa still bear the name of Cafsa or Ghafsah. It was 
an important city m the extreme south of Numidia, situate in an oasis, 
in the midst of an arid desert abounding in serpents. In the Jugurthiuo 
war it was the treasury of Jugurtha, and was taken and destroyed by 
Marius ; but was afterwards rebuilt and made a colony.

Berenice is situate upon the outer promontory that bounds 
the Sp'tis ; it was formerly called the city of the Hesperides 
(previously mentioned''), according to the fables of the 

1 The same that has been abeady mentioned in B. ii, c. 106. It is 
mentioned by Herodotus and Pomponius Mela. 

2 Previously called Hesperis or Hesperides. It was the most westerly 
city of Cyrenaica, and stood just beyond the eastern extremity of the 
Greater Syrtis, on a promontory called Pseudopenias, and near the river 
Lethon. Its historical unportance only dates from the times of the 
Ptolemies, when it was named Berenice, after the vnfe of Ptolemy III. 
or Euergetes. Havmg been greatly reduced, it was fortified anew by the 
Emperor Justmian. Its ruins are to be seen at the modern Ben Grhazi. 

3 So called from Arsinoe, the sister of Ptolemy Pliiladelphus. Its 
earUer name was Tauchefra or Teuchefra, wliich name, according to 
Marcus, it still retains. 

^ Its ruins may still be seen at Tolmeita or Tolometa. It was situate 
on the N.W. coast of Cyrenaica, and originally bore the name of Barca. 
From which of the Ptolemies it took its name is not known. Its splendid 
ruins are not less than four miles m circumference. 

5 Its ruuis are still to be seen, bespeaking its former splendour, at the 
modem Marsa Sousah. It was originally only the port of Cyrene, but 
mider the Ptolemies it floiunshed to such an extent as to eehpse that 
city. It is pretty certain that it was the Sozusa of the later Greek A^Titers. 
Eratosthenes was a native of this place. 

^ The cliief city of Cyrenaica, and the most important Hellenic colony 
in Africa, the early settlers having extensively intermarried with wives of 
Libyan parentage. In its most prosperous times it maintained an ex- 
tensive commerce with Greece and Egypt, especially in silpliium or 
assafoetida, the plantations of Avliich, as mentioned in the present chapter, 
extended for miles in its vicinity. Great quantities of tliis plant were 
also exported to Capua in Southern Italy, where it was extensively 
employed in the manufacture of perfumes. The scene of the ' Rudens,' 
the most picturesque (if we may use the term) of the plays of Plautus, is 
laid in the vicinity of Cyrene, and frequent reference is made in it to the 
extensive cultivation of silphium ; a head of which plant also appears on 
the coins of the place. The philosophers Aristippus and Carneades were 
bom here, as also the poet Calhmachus. Its ruins, at the modem 
Glu'ennah, are very extensive, and are incUcative of its former splendour. 

^ In C. 1 of the present Book. It was only the poetical fancy of the 
Greeks that fomad the fabled gardens of the Hesperides in the fertile re- 
gions of Cyrenaica. Scylax distinctly mentions the gardens and the lake 
of the Hesperides in this vicinity, where we also Ihid a people called 
Hesperidse, or, as Herodotus names them, Euesperidse. It was probably 
in consequence of this similarity of name, in a gre^^t degree, that the 
gardens of the Hesperides were assigned to this locality.

Greeks, Avliicli very often change tlieir localities. Not far 
from tlie city, and running before it, is the river Lethon, 
and with it a sacred grove, where the gardens of the Hes- 
perides are said to have formerly stood ; this city is distant 
from Leptis 375 miles. Prom Berenice to Arsinoe, com- 
monly called Teuchii'a, is forty-three miles ; after which, at 
a distance of twenty-two, we come to Ptolemais, the ancient 
name of which was Barce ; and at a distance of forty miles 
from this last the Promontory of Phycus\ which extends far 
away into the Cretan Sea, being 350 miles distant from Taena- 
rum-, the promontory of Laconia, and from Crete 225. After 
passing tliis promontory we come to Cyreue, which stands 
at a distance of eleven miles from the sea. Prom Phycus 
to ApoUonia^ is twenty-four miles, and from thence to the 
Chersonesus^ eighty-eight ; from which to Catabathmos^ is a 
distance of 216 miles. The Marmarida^'^ inhabit this coast, 
extending from almost the region of Para^tonium^ to the 
Greater Syrtis ; after them the Ararauceles, and then, upon 
the coasts of the Syrtis, the Nasamones^, whom the Greeks 

^ IS'ow called Eas-Sem or Eas-El-Kazat. It is situate a little to the 
west of Apolloilia and N.W. of Cyrene. 

" According to Ansart, 264 miles is the real distance between Capes 
Bas-Sem and Tsenarum or Matapan. 

3 As ah'eady mentioned, Apollonia formed the harbour of Cyrene. 

^ This was called the Chersonesus Magna, being so named in contra- 
chstmction to the Chersonesus Parva, on the coast of Egypt, about thirty- 
five miles west of Alexandria. It is now called Kas-£1-Tm, or more 
commonly Raxatin. 

^ So called from the pecuhar features of the locahty, the Greek word 
KaTa(ia9ixus, signifying "a descent." A deep valley, bounded east! and 
west by ranges of liigh hills, runs from this spot to the frontiers of 
Egypt. It is again mentioned by Phny at the end of the present 
Chapter. The spot is still known by a similar name, being called JMarsa 
Sollem, or the " Port of the Ladder." In earlier times the Eg}ptian 
territory ended at the Gulf of Plinthinethes, now Lago Segio, and did not 
extend so far as Catabathmos. 

6 This name was unknown to Herodotus. As Marcus observes, it 
was probably of Phoenician origin, signifying " leaduig a wandermg life," 
like the term " nomad," derived from the Greek. 

" Now called El Bareton or Marsa-Labeit. This city was of consi- 
derable importance, and belonged ]&gt;roperly to Marmaria, but was included 
politically in the Nomos Libya of Egypt. It stood i^oar the promontory 
of Artos or Pythis, now Ras-El-IIazeit. 

8 So called from the words Maid-Ammon; " the tribe of Amnion,'* ac-

formerly called Mesammones, from the circumstance of 
their being located in the very midst of sands \ The terri- 
tory of Cyrene, to a distance of fifteen miles from the shore, 
is said to abound in trees, while for the same distance 
beyond that district it is only suitable for the cultivation of 
corn : after which, a tract of land, thirty miles in breadth 
and 250 in length, is productive of nothing but laser [or 
silphium^]. 

After tlie Nasamones we come to the dwellings of the 
Asbystae and the Macae^ and beyond them, at eleven days' 
journey to the west of the Greater Syrtis, the Amantes", a 
people also surrounded by sands in every direction. They 
find water however without any difficulty at a depth mostly 
of about two cubits, as their district receives the overflow of 
the waters of Mauritania. They build houses mth blocks 
of salt^, which they cut out of their mountains just as we 
do stone. From this nation to the Troglodytse*' the distance 
is seven days' journey in a south-westerly direction, a peo- 
ple with whom our only intercourse is for the purpose of 
procuring from them the precious stone which we call the 
carbuncle, and which is brought from the interior of Ethiopia. 
Upon the road to this last people, but turning oif towards 
the deserts of Africa, of which we have previously' made 
mention as lying beyond the Lesser Syrtis, is the region of 
Phazania^ ; the nation of Phazanii, belonging to which, as 

cording to Bochart. The Nasamones were a powerful but savage people 
of Libya, who dwelt originally on the shores of the Greater Syrtis, but 
were driven inland by the G-reek settlers of Cyrenaica, and afterwards by 
the Eomans. i From neaos " the middle," and d/nnos " sand." 

" See note ^ in p. 396. 

2 Herodotus places this nation to the west of the Nasamones and on 
the river Cinyps, now called the Wadi-Quaham. 

*♦ In most of the editions they are eaUed ' Hammanientes.' It has been 
suggested that they were so called from the Greek word d/xfios " sand." 

^ This story he borrows from Herodotus, B. iv. c. 158. 

^ From the Greek word rpioyXo^vTai, " dwellers m caves." Pliny has 
used the term already (B. iv. c. 25) in reference to the nations on the banks 
of the Danube. It was a general name applied by the Greek geographers 
to various unciviHzed races who had no abodes but caves, and more 
especially to the inhabitants of the western coasts of the Eed Sea, along 
the shores of Upper Egypt and Ethiopia.

^vell as the cities of Alele^ and Cilliba^, we have subdued 
by force of anns, as also Cydamus^, which lies over against 
Sabrata. After passing these places a range of mountains 
extends in a prolonged chain from east to west : these have 
received from our people the name of the Black Moun- 
tains"*, either from the appearance which they naturally bear 
of having been exposed to the action of fire, or else from the 
fact that they have been scorched by the reflection of the 
sun's rays. Beyond it" is the desert, and then Talgse, a city of 
the Garamantes, and Debris, at which place there is a spring'', 
the waters of which, from noon to midnight, are at boiling 
heat, and then freeze for as many hours until the following 
noon ; Garama too, that most famous capital of the Ga- 
ramantes ; all which places have been subdued by the Roman 
arms. It was on this occasion that Cornelius Balbus'' was 
honoured with a triumph, the only foreigner indeed that was 
ever honoui'ed with the triumphal chariot, and presented 
with the rights of a Eoman citizen ; for, although by birth 
a native of Gades, the Roman citizenship was granted to him 
as well as to the elder Balbus^, his uncle by the father's side. 
There is also this remarkable circumstance, that our writers 

^ Now called Tanet-lVIellixlen, or the station of Melluleu, on the route 
from Gadamez to Osei'ona. 

2 Zaoiiila or Zala, half way between Aiig;v'la and Mourzouk. 

3 Now GadameZj which, according to Marcvis, is situate almost under 
the same meridian as Old Tripoli, the ancient Sabrata. 

^ According to Marcus this range still bears the name of Gibel-Assoud, 
wliich in the Arabic language means the " Black Mountam." 

5 In a southerly dh'ection. He alludes probably to the Desert of 
Bildulgerid. 

^ This spring is also mentioned by Pliny in B. ii. c. 106. Marcus sug- 
gests that the Debris of Pliny is the same as the Bedir of Ptolemy. He 
also remarks that the Enghsh traveller Oudney discovered caverns hcwni 
out of the sides of the hills, evidently for the pui-poses of habitation, but 
of wlxich the use is not kno\m by the present people. These he con- 
Biders to have been the abodes of the ancient Troglodyte or "cave- 
dwellers." In the Tibesti range of mountains, however, we find a race 
called the Rock Tibboos, from the circumstance of their dweUing in caves. 

7 Comehus Balbus G-aditanus the Younger, who, upon his victories 
over the Garamantes, obtained a triumph in the year B.C. 19. 

8 L. Cornelius Balbus the Elder, also a native of Gades. He obtained 
the consulship in B.C. 40, the first instance, as we find mentioned by 
Phny, B. vii. c. 44, in which this honour had been conferred upon oue 
who was not a Roman citizen.

have lianiled down to us the names of the cities above-men- 
tioned as having been taken by Balbus, and have informed 
us that on the occasion of his triumph \ besides Cy damns 
and Grarama", there were carried in the procession the 
names and models of all the other nations and cities, in 
the following order: the town of Tabudium^, the nation 
of Niteris, the town of Nigligemella, the nation or town of 
Bubeimn^, the nation of Enipi, the town of Thuben, the 
mountain known as the Black Mountain, Nitibrum, the 
towns called Eapsa, the nation of Discera^, the town of 
Debris^, the river Nathabur'', the town of Thapsagum^, 
the nation of Nannagi, the town of Boin, the town of

folloAving order, of Baracum, Buluba, Alasit, Gralia, Balla, 
Maxalla^*^, Zizama, and Mount Gryri^\ which was preceded by 

^ On the occasion of a triumph by a Roman general, boards were 
carried aloft on "fercula," on wliich were painted in large lettei's the names 
of vanquished nations and countries. Here too models were exliibited in 
ivory or wood of the cities and forts captured, and pictures of the moun- 
tains, rivers, and other great natural features of the subjugated region, 
with appropriate inscriptions. Marcus is of opinion that the names of 
the places here mentioned do not succeed in any geographical order, but 
solely according to their presumed importance as forming part of the 
conquest of Balbus. He also thinks that Balbus did not penetrate 
beyond the fifteenth degree of north latitude, and that his conquests did 
not extend so far south as the banks of Lake Tchad. 

^ The site of Garama stUl bears the name of ' Gherma,' and presents 
very considerable remams of antiquity. It is four days' journey north 
of Mourzouk, the capital of Fezzan. 

3 Now Tibesti, according to Marcus. 

^ Marcus suggests that this is probably the Febabo of modei*n geo- 
graphers, to the N.E. of Belma and Tibesti. 

* Discera was the Im-Zerah of modern travellers, on the road from 
Sockna to Mourzouk, according to Marcus, who is of opinion that the 
places which foUow were situate at the east and north-east of Thuben 
and the Black Momitain. 

^ Om-El-Abid, to the N.W. of Garama or Gherma, according to 
Marcus, and Oudney the traveller. 

7 The same, Marcus thinks, as the modern Tessava in Fezzan.

ancient Pega, according to Marcus. '

an inscription stating that this was the place where precious 
stones were produced. 

Up to tlie present time it has been found impracticable 
to keep open the road that leads to the country of the 
Garamantes, as the predatory bands of that nation have filled 
up the Avells with sand, which do not require to be dug for 
to any great depth, if you only have a knowledge of the 
locality. In the late war^ however, which, at the beginning 
of the reign of the Emperor Yespasian, the Eomans carried 
on with the people of (Ea, a short cut of only four days' 
journey was discovered ; this road is known as the " Prceter 
Caput Saxi^." The last place in the territory of Cyrenaica 
is Catabathmos, consisting of a tovm, and a valley M-ith a 
sudden and steep descent. The length of C}Tenean Africa, 
up to this boundary from the Lesser Syrtis, is 1060 miles ; 
and, so far as has been ascertained, it is 800^ in breadth. 

CHAP. 6. (6.) — LIBYA MAEEOTIS. 

The region that follows is called Libya Mareotis^, and 
borders upon Egypt. It is held by the Marmaridae, the 
Adyrmachidae, and, after them, the Mareotae. The di- 
stance from Catabathmos to Paraetonium is eighty-six 

travellers Denham, Clapperton, and Oudney, where, confirming the 
statement here made by Pliny, they foxmd quartz, jasper, onyx, agates, 
and comeHans. 

* Mentioned by Tacitus, B. iv. c. 50. The town of (Ea has been 
alluded to by Phny ia C. 4. 

2 "Past the head of the rock." Marcus suggests that this is the 
Gibel-Gclat or Rock of Gelat spoken of by the Enghsh travellers Den- 
ham, Clapperton, and Oudney, forming a portion of the chain of Guriano 
or Gyr. He says, that at the foot of this mountain travellers have to 
pass from Old andTsewTripoU on their road toMissolat, tlioMaxala of 
Phny, and thence to Gerama or Gherma, tlie ancient capital of Fezzan. 

3 As Marcus observes, this would not make it to extend so far south 
as the sixteenth degree of north latitude. 

^ The Mareotis of the time of the Ptolemies extended from Alexandria 
to the Gulf of PHnthinethes ; and Libya was properly that portion of 
territory which extended from that Gulf to Catabathmos. PHny is in 
error here in confounding the two appellations, or rather, blending them 
into one. It includes the eastern portion of the modern Barca, and the 
western division of Lower Egypt. It most probably received its name 
from the Lake Mareotis, and not the lake from it.

miles. In tbis district is Apis^ a place rendered famous by 
the religious belief of Egypt. From this town Paraetonium 
is distant sixty-two miles, and from thence to Alexandria 
the distance is 200 miles, the breadth of the district being 
169. Eratosthenes says that it is 525 miles by land from 
Cyrene to Alexandria ; while Agrippa gives the length of 
the whole of Africa from the Atlantic Sea, and including 
Lower Egypt, as 3040 miles. Polybius and Eratosthenes, 
who are generally considered as remarkable for their extreme 
correctness, state the length to be, from the ocean to Great 
Carthage 1100 miles, and from Carthage to Canopus, the 
nearest mouth of the Nile, 1628 miles ; while Isidorus speaks 
of the distance from Tingi to Canopus as being 3599 miles. 
Artemidorus makes this last distance forty miles less than 
Isidorus. 

CHAP. 7. (7.) — THE ISLAIfDS IN THE VICINITY OF AEEICA. 

These seas contain not so very many islands. The most 
famous among them is Meninx^, twenty-five miles in length 
and twenty-two in breadth: by Eratosthenes it is called 
Lotophagitis. This island has two towns, Meninx on the 
side whicli faces Africa, and Troas on the other ; it is situate 
off the promontory which lies on the right-hand side of the 
Lesser Syrtis, at a distance of a mile and a half. One hun- 
dred miles from this island, and opposite the promontory 
that lies on the left, is the free island of Cercina^, with a 

^ This was a seaport town on the northern coast of Africa, probably 
about eleven or twelve miles west of Pargetonium, sometimes spoken of 
as belonging to Egypt, sometimes to Marmorica. Scylax places it at the 
western boundary of Egypt, on the frontier of the Marmaridse. Ptolemy, 
hke Pliny, speaks of it as being in the Libyan Nomos. The distances 
given m the MSS. of Pliny of this place from Paraetonium are seventy- 
two, sixty-two, and twelve miles ; the latter is probably the correct 
reading, as Strabo, B. xvii., makes the distance 100 stadia. It is extremely 
doubtful whether the Apis mentioned by Herodotus, B. ii. c. 18, can be 
the same place : but there is Kttle doubt, from the words of Pliny here, 
that it was dedicated to the worsliip of the Egyptian god Apis, who was 
represented under the form of a buU. 

2 Now caUed Zerbi and Jerba, derived from the name of Grirba, which 
even in the time of Aurehus Victor, had supplanted that of Meninx. It 
is situate in the Gulf of Cabes. According to SoHnus, C. Marius lay in 
concealment here for some time. It was famous for its purple. See 
B. ix. c. 60. 3 jj^Q^y called Kerkeni, Karkenah, or Eamlah.

city of the same name. It is twenty-five miles long, and 
half that breadth at the place where it is the widest, but 
not more than five miles across at the extremity : the di- 
minutive island of Cercinitis\ which looks towards Car- 
thage, is united to it by a bridge. At a distance of nearly 
fifty miles from these is the island of Lopadusa'^, six miles 
in length ; and beyond it Graulos and Galata, the soil of which 
kills the scorpion, that noxious reptile of Africa. It is 
also said that the scorpion ^vill not live at Glypea ; opposite 
to which place lies the island of Cosyra^, with a town of the 
same name. Opposite to the Grulf of Carthage are the two 
islands known as the ^gimuri''; the Altars^ which are 
rather rocks than islands, lie more between Sicily and Sar- 
dinia. There are some authors who state that these rocks 
were once inhabited, but that they have gradually subsided 
in the sea. 

CHAP. 8. (8.) — COTJNTEIES ON THE OTHEE SIDE OE AFEICA. 

If we pass through the interior of Africa in a southerly 
direction, beyond the Grsetuli, after having traversed the 
intervening deserts, we shall find, first of all the Liby- 
Egyptians^, and then the country where the Leucsethio- 

^ Now Gherba. It was reckoned as a mere appendage to Cercina, to 
which it was joined by a mole, and which is found often mentioned in 
history.

Gaulos and Galata, has been already mentioned among the islands off 
Sicily ; see B. iii. c. 14. 

3 Now Pantellaria. See B. iii. c. 14. • 

* A lofty island surrounded by dangerous cliffs, now called Zbwamour 
or Zembra. 

^ In the former editions the word "Arse" is taken to refer to the 
jEgimuri, as meaning the same islands. SiUig is however of opinion 
that totally distinct groups are meant, and punctuates accordingly. The 
" Arse " were probably mere rocks lying out at sea, which received their 
name from their fancied resemblance to altars. They are mentioned by 
Virgil in the jEneid,B. i. 1. 113, upon which hncs Servius says, that they 
were so called because there tlie Romans and the people of Africa on 
one occasion made a treaty. 

^ The greater portion of this Chapter is extracted almost verbatim 
from the account given by Mela. Ptolemy seems to place the Liby- 
Egyptians to the south of the Greater and Lesser Oasis, on the route 
thence to Darfour.

Ethiopia, so called from the river Nigris"*, which has been 
previously mentioned, the Gymnetes^, siirnamed Pharusii, 
and, on the very margin of the ocean, the Perorsi®, whom 
we have already spoken of as lying on the boundaries 
of Mauritania. After passing all these peoples, there are 
vast deserts towards the east until we come to the Gara- 
mantes, the Augylse, and the Troglodytse; the opinion of 
those being exceedingly well founded who place two -^thio- 
pias beyond the deserts of Africa, and more particularly 
that expressed by Homer'', who tells us that the ^Ethiopians 
are divided into two nations, those of the east and those of 
the west. The river Nigris has tlie same characteristics as 
the Nile ; it produces the calamus, the papyrus, and just 
the same animals, and it rises at the same seasons of the 
year. Its source is between the Tarrselian Ethiopians 
and the CEcahcae. Magium, the city of the latter people, 
has been placed by some writers amid the deserts, and, next 

1 Or "White Ethiopians," men though of dark complexion, not 
negroes. Marcus is of opinion that the words " intervenientibus desertis" 
refer to the tract of desert country lying between the Leucsethiopians and 
the Liby-Egyptians, and not to that between the Gaetuhans on the one 
hand and the Liby-Egyptians and the Leucsethiopians on the other. 

2 Meaning to the sovith and the south-east of these three nations, accord- 
ing to Marcus. Kennel takes the Leucsethiopians to be the present Man- 
dingos of higher Senegambia : Marcus however thhiks that they are the 
Azanaghis, who dweU on the edge of the Great Desert, and are not of so 
black a complexion as the Mandingos. 

3 Probably the people of the present Nigritia or Soudan. 

* Marcus is of opmion that Pliny does not here refer to the Joliba of 
Park and other travellers, as other commentators have supposed ; but 
that he speaks of the river called Zis by the modern geographers, and 
wliich Jackson speaks of as flowing from the south-east towards north-west. 
The whole subject of the Niger is however enwrapped in almost impene- 
trable obscurity, and as the most recent inquirers have not come to any 
conclusion on the subject, it would be httle more than a waste of time 
and space to enter upon an mvestigation of the notions which Phny and 
Mela entertained on the subject, ^ From yvfivos, "naked."

to them the Atlantes ; then the Mgiipani, half men, half 
beasts, the Blemmyae^ the Gamphasautes, the Satyri, and 
the Himantopodes. 

The Atlantes^, if we believe what is said, have lost all 
characteristics of humanity ; for there is no mode of distin- 
guishing each other among tliem by names, and as they look 
upon the rising and the setting sun, they give utterance to 
direful imprecations against it, as being deadly to them- 
selves and their lands ; nor are they visited with dreams^, like 
the rest of mortals. The Troglodytae make excavations in 
the earth, which serve them for dwellings ; the flesh of ser- 
pents is their food ; they have no articulate voice, but 
only utter a kind of squeaking noise"* ; and thus are they 
utterly destitute of all means of communication by language. 
The Graramantes have no institution of marriage among 
them, and live in promiscuous concubinage with their 
women. The Augylse worship no deities^ but the gods of the 
infernal regions. The Gamphasautes, who go naked, and 
are unacquainted with war^, hold no intercourse whatever 
with strangers. The Blemmya^ are said to have no heads, 

^ A tribe of Ethiopia, whose position varied considerably at different 
epochs of histoxy. Their predatory and savage habits caused the most 
extraordinary reports to be spread of their appearance and ferocity. 
Tlie more ancient geographers bring them as far westward as the region 
beyond the Libyan Desert, and into the vicinity of the Oases. In the 
time however of the Antonines, when Ptolemy was composing his de- 
scription of Africa, they appear to the south and east of Egypt, in the 
wide and almost mxknown tract which lay between the rivers Astapus 
and Astobores. 

2 Mela speaks of this race as situate farthest to the west. The de- 
scription of them here given is from Herodotus, B. iv. c. 183-185, who 
speaks of them under the name of " Atarantcs." 

3 The people who are visited by no dreams, are called Atlantes by 
Herodotus, the same name by which Pliny calls them. He says that 
their territory is ten days' journey from that of the Atarantes. 

* This also is borrowed from Herodotus. As some confirmation of 
this account, it is worthy of remark, that the Kock Tibboos of the pre- 
ecnt day, who, like the ancient Troglodytir, dwell in caves, have so 
pecuUar a kind of speech, that it is com]iared by the people of Aujelah 
to nothing but the whistling of birds. The TroglodytaD of Fezzan are 
liere referred to, not those of the coasts of the Red Sea. 

5 Mela says that they look upon the Manes or spu-its of the departed 
as their only deities.

their mouths atid eyes being seated in their breasts. The 
Satyri\ beyond their figure, have nothing in common with 
the manners of the human race, and the form of the -^gi- 
pani^ is such as is commonly represented in paintings. The 
Himantopodes^ are a race of people with feet resembling 
thongs, upon which they move along by nature with a ser- 
pentine, crawling kind of gait. The Pharusii, descended 
from the ancient Persians, are said to have been the compa- 
nions of Hercules when on his expedition to the Hesperides. 
Beyond the above, I have met with nothing relative to 
Africa^ worthy of mention.

Joining on to Africa is Asia, the extent of which, accord- 
ing to Timosthenes, from the Canopic mouth of the Nile 
to the mouth of the Euxine, is 2689 miles. From the 
mouth of the Euxine to that of Lake Mseotis is, according to 
Eratosthenes, 1545 mdes. The whole distance to the Ta- 
nais, including Egypt, is, according to Artemidorus and 
Isidorus, 6375^ miles. The seas of Egypt, which are several

horns, long ears, and tails. They were probably monkeys, which had been 
mistaken for men. 2 Half goat, half man. See the Note relative to 
JEgipan, in C. 1 of the present Book, p. 378. 

** Evidently intended to be derived from the Greek tjuds "a thong," 
and Tropes " the feet." It is most probable that the name of a savage 
people in the interior bore a fancied resemblance to this word, upon 
which the marvellous story here stated was coined for the purpose of 
tallying with the name. From a statement in the ^thiopica of HeUo- 
dorus, B. X., Marcus suggests that the story as to theBlemmyse having 
no heads arose from the cfrcumstance, that on the invasion of the Per- 
sians they were in the habit of falling on one knee and bovmig the head 
to the breast, by which means, without injury to themselves, they 
afforded a passage to the horses of the enemy. 

^ It must be remembered, as afready mentioned, that the ancients 
looked upon Egypt as forming part of Asia, not of Africa. It seems 
impossible to say how this supposition arose, when the Red Sea and the 
Isthmus of Suez form so natural and so jaalpable a frontier between 
Asia and Africa.

the MSS. of oiu* author.

in number, have received their names from those who dwell 
upon their shores, for which reason they will be mentioned 
together. 

Egypt is the country which lies next to Africa ; in the in- 
terior it runs in a southerly direction, as far as the territory 
of the Ethiopians, who lie extended at the back of it. The 
river IS'ile, dividing itself, forms on the right and left the 
boundary- of its lower part, which it embraces on every side\ 
By the Canopic mouth of that river it is separated from 
Africa, and by the Pelusiac from Asia, there being a distance 
between the two of 170 miles. For this reason it is that 
some persons have reckoned "Egypt among the islands, the 
Nile so dividing itself as to give a triangular form to the 
land which it encloses: from which circumstance also 
many persons have named Egypt the Delta-, after that of 
the Greek letter so called. The distance from the spot 
where the channel of the river first divides into branches, to 
the Canopic mouth, is 146 miles, and to the Pelusiac, 166. 

The upper part of Egypt, which borders on Ethiopia, is 
known as Thebais. This district is divided into prefec- 
tures of towns, which are generally designated as " Nomes." 
These are Ombite3^ Apollopolites^ Hermonthites^ Thi- 
nites^ Phaturites^ Coptites^ Tentyrites^ Diopolites'*', An- 

1 Parisot remarks that Pliny is in error in this statement. A consi- 
derable part of Lower Egypt lay both on the right and left of the Delta 
or island formed by the branches of the Nile. ' It must be remembered, 
however, that our author has ah-eady included a portion of what was 
strictly Egypt, in his description of Libya Mareotis.

Egyptian monarchy. It worshipped Osiris. Its capital was This, after-

strict which lies in the vicinity of Pelusium contains the 
following Nomes, Pharbsethites, Bubastites'*, Sethroites, 
and Tanites^. The remaining Nomes are those called the 
Arabian ; the Hammonian, which lies on the road to the 
oracle of Jupiter Hammon ; and those known by the names 
of Oxyrynchites, Leontopolites, Athribites^, Cynopolites'^,

Alexandria, besides Mareotis in Libya. 

Heracleopolites^^ is a Nome on an island^^ of the Nile, 

for its chief town Chemmis or Panopolis. It paid divine honours to a 
deified hero. 
^ It probably worshipped Typhon. Its capital was Antseopolis. 

2 Probably an offshoot from a nome in theHeptanomis of similar name. 

3 Dedicated to the worship of the wolf. Its chief town was Lycopohs. 
It should be remarked that these names do not appear to be given by 
Pliny in their proper geographieal order. 

^ Some of these nomes were inconsiderable and of httle importance. 
The Bubastite nome worshipped Bubastis, Artemis, or Diana, of whom. ' 
it contained a fine temple. 

•'' Its chief town was Tanis. In this nome, according to tradition, 
Moses was born. 

^ Its capital was Athribis, where the shrew-mouse and crocodile were 
worshipped. 

7 The seat of the worship of the dog-headed deity Anubis. Its capital 
was CynopoUs ; which is to be distingiiished from the Deltic city and 
other places of that name, as this was a nome of the Heptanomis or 
Middle Egypt, to which also the Hammonian nome belonged. 

^ The border nome of Upper and Middle Egypt. 

^ Its capital was Paclmamunis. It worshipped a goddess correspond- 
ing to the Greek Leto, or the Latona of the Romans. 

'^ Its capital was Busiris. It worshipped Isis, and at one period was 
said to have sacrificed the nomad tribes of Syria and Arabia. 

^^ Its chief town was Onuphis. 

^2 Its chief city was Sais, and it worshipped Neith or Athene, and 
contained the tomb and a sanctuary of Osiris. ^^ Its capital was Tava. 

^■^ Its chief town was Naucratis on the coast, the birth-place of Athe- 
nseus, the Deipnosophist. By some authors it is made part of the Saitic 
nome. The names given by PUny vary very considerably from those 
found in others of the ancient writers. 

^^ The capital of this nome was Heracleopolis, 'The city of Hercules,* 
as Pliny calls it, situate, as he says, on an island, at the entrance of the

fifty miles in length, upon which there is a city, called the 
' City of Hercules.' There are two places called Arsiuoites^ : 
these and Memphites^ extend to the apex^ of the Delta ; ad- 
joining to which, on the side of Africa, are the two Nomes 
of Oasites"*. Some writers vary in some of these names and 
substitute for them other Nomes, such as Heroopolites^ 
and Crocodilopolites^ Between Ai-sinoites and Mem- 
phites, a lake^ 250 miles, or, according to what Muci- 
anus says, 450 miles in circumference and fifty paces deep, 
has been formed by artificial means: after the king by 
whose orders it was made, it is called by the name of Moeris. 
The distance from thence to Memphis is nearly sixty-two 
miles, a place which was formerly the citadel of the kings of 
Egypt ; from thence to the oracle of Hammon it is twelve 
days' journey. Memphis is fifteen miles from the spot where 
the river Nile di^ddes into the diff'erent channels which we 
have mentioned as forming the Delta. 

nome of Arsinoites, formed by the Nile and a canal. After Memphis 
and HeHopolis, it waa probably the most important city couth of the 
Thebaid. Its ruins arc inconsiderable ; a portion of them are to be seen 
at the modern hamlet of Amasieh. 

1 He probably means Arsinoe or Arsinoitis, the chief to^vn of the 
nome of that name, and the city so called at the northern extremity of 
the HeroopoUte Gulf in the Eed Sea. Tho former is denoted by the 
modem district of El-Fayoom, the most fertile of ancient Egypt. At 
this place the crocodile was worshipped. The Labyrinth and Lake 
Moeris were in this nome. Extensive ruins at IVIedinot-el-Fayoom, or 
El-Fares, represent its site. The modem Ardscherud, a village near 
Suez, corresponds to Arsinoe on the Red Sea. There is some lit tie doubt 
however whether this last Arsinoe is the one here meant by Phny. 

2 Memphis was the chief city of this nome, which was situate in 
Middle Egypt, and was the capital of the whole country, and the resi- 
dence of the Pharaohs, who succeeded Psammctichus, B.C. 616. This 
nome rose in importance on the decline of the kingdom of Thobais, but 
was afterwards echpsed by tho progress of Alexandria under the suc- 
cessors of Alexander the Great.

CHAP. 10. — THE EIVEE NILE. 

The sources of tlie Nile^ are unascertained, and, travelling 
as it does for an immense distance through deserts and burn- 
ing sands, it is only known to us by common report, having 
neither experienced the vicissitudes of warfare, nor been 
visited by those arms which have so effectually explored all 
other regions. It rises, so far indeed as King Juba was 
enabled to ascertain, in a mountain^ of Lower Mauritania, 
not far from the ocean ; immediately after which it forms a 
lake of standing water, which bears the name of Nilides^. 
In this lake are found the several kinds of fish known by 
the names of alabeta'*, coracinus, and silurus ; a crocodile 
also was brought thence as a proof that this really is the 
Nile, and was consecrated by Juba himself in the temple of 
Isis at Csesarea', where it may be seen at the present day. 
In addition to these facts, it has been observed that the 
waters of the Nile rise in the same proportion in which the 

subsequent distribution of a part of the overflow of the Nile. The sup- 
position that it was formed by artificial means is now pretty generally 
exploded, and it is regarded as of natural formation. It was situate in 
the nome of Arsinoites or Crocodilopohtes. Its length seems to be over- 
stated by our author, as at the present day it is only thirty miles in 
length and five in breadth at the widest part. 

^ And it is generally supposed that they are so up to the present day. 
The ethnographer Jablonski is of opinion that this river derives its name 
from the Coptish word tneialei " to rise at stated times." Servius, the 
commentator on Virgil, says that it is derived from the two Greek words 
vea iXvs "fresh mud," in allusion to the fresh mud or slime which it 
leaves after each inimdation. Singularly enough, ChampolHon prefers 
this silly etymology to that suggested by Jablonski. 

2 An interesting disquisition on the probable sources of the Nile, as 
viewed by the ancients, is to be foimd in the Ninth Book of Lucan's 
Pharsaha. The Indian word " mZas," "black," has also been suggested 
as its possible origin. 

3 What spot is meant under this name, if indeed it is anything more 
than the creation of fancy, it is impossible to ascertain vrith any degree 
of precision. It is possible however that the ancients may have had 
some knowledge of "Lake Tchad, and the Moimtains of the Moon, or 
Djebel-Kumri, though at the same time it is more than doubtful that 
the Nile has its source in either of those locahties, the former especially. 

* Perhaps a kind of river lamprey. As to the Coracinus, see B. ix. 
c. 24, 32, and B. xxxii. c. 19, 24, 34, 44, and 53 ; and as to tke Silurus,

snows and rains of Mauritania increase. Pouring forth from 
this lake, the river disdains to flow through arid and sandy 
deserts, and for a distance of several days' journey conceals 
itself; after which it bursts forth at another lake of greater 
magnitude in the country of the Massaesyli^ a people of 
Mauritania Caesariensis, and thence casts a glance around, as 
it were, upon the communities of men in its vicinity, giving 
proofs of its identity in the same peculiarities of the animals 
which it produces. It then buries itself once again in the 
sands of the desert, and remains concealed for a distance of 
twenty days' journey, till it has reached the confines of ^Ethio- 
pia. Here, when it has once more become sensible of the pre- 
sence of man, it again emerges, at the same source, in all pro- 
bability, to which writers have given the name of Niger, or 
Black. After this, fonning the boundary-line between Africa 
and Ethiopia, its banks, though not immediately peopled by 
man, are the resort of numbers of vrild beasts and ani- 
mals of various kinds. Giving birth in its course to dense 
forests of trees, it travels through the middle of ^Ethiopia, 
under the name of Astapus, a word which signifies, in the 
language of the nations who dwell in those regions, " water 
issuing from the shades below." Proceeding onwards, it 
divides^ innumerable islands in its course, and some of them 
of such vast magnitude, that although its tide runs with the 
greatest rapidity, it is not less than five days in passing 
them. When making the circuit of Meroe, the most 
famous of these islands, the left branch of the river is called 
Astobores^, or, in other words, " an arm of the water that 
issues from the shades," while the right arm has the name 
of Astosapes^, which adds to its original signification the 

^ A district which in reahty was at least 1200 or 1500 miles distant 
. from any part of the Nile, and probably near 3000 from its real source. 

2 " Spargit." It is doubtful whether tliis word means hero " waters," 
or " divides." Probably however the latter is its meaning. 

3 This is the third or eastern branch of the river, now known as the 
Tacazze. It rises in the higlilands of Abyssinia, in about 11° 40' north 
lat. and 39° 40^ east long., and joins the main stream of the Nile, formed 
by the union of the Abiad and tlie Azrek, in 17° 45' north lat. and about 
34° 5' east long. ; the point of junction being the apex of the island of 
Meroe, here mentioned by Phny. 

* Possibly by this name he designates the Bahr-el-Abied, or White 
Eiver, the main stream of the Nile, the sources of which have not been

meaning of " side^" It does not obtain the name of " Mle'* 
until its waters have again met and are united in a single 
stream ; and even then, for some miles both above and 
below the point of confluence, it has the name of Siris. 
Homer has given to the whole of this river the name of 
JEgyptus, while other writers again have called it Triton^. 
Every now and then its course is interrupted by islands which 
intervene, and which only serve as so many incentives to 
add to the impetuosity of its torrent ; and though at last 
it is hemmed in by mountains on either side, in no part is 
the tide more rapid and precipitate. Its waters then hasten- 
ing onwards, it is borne along to the spot in the country of 
the ^Ethiopians which is known by the name of "Catadupi^ ;" 
where, at the last Cataract*, the complaint is, not that it 
flows, but that it rushes, with an immense noise between the 
rocks that lie in its way : after which it becomes more 
smooth, the violence of its waters is broken and subdued, 
and, wearied out as it were by the length of the distance it 
has travelled, it discharges itself, though by many mouths^, 
into the Eg}^tian sea. During certain days of the year, how- 
ever, the volume of its waters is greatly increased, and as it 
traverses the whole of Egypt, it inundates the earth, and, 
by so doing, greatly promotes its fertility. 

There have been various reasons suggested for this increase 
of the river. Of these, however, the most probable are, 

hitherto satisfactorily ascertained. The Astapus is supposed to have 
been really the name of the Bahr-el-Azrek, or Blue River, the third 
branch of the Nile, the sources of which are in the liiglilands of Abys- 
sinia, in about 11° 40' north lat, and 39° 40' east long. 

^ Or " side of the water that issues from the shades." As Hardouin 
says, this does not appear to be a very satisfactory explanation. 

2 Said by Tzetzes to have been derived from the Greek rptVos, '* the 
third," because it had three times changed its name : having been called, 
first, the Ocean ; secondly, Aetus, or the Eagle ; and thhdly, ^gyptus. 

3 Or the " Cataracts," for which it is the G-reek name. The most 
northerly of these cataracts, called the First Cataract, is, and always 
has been, the southern boundary of Egypt. According to the most 
recent accomits, these Cataracts are devoid of any stupendous features, 
sucli as characterize the Falls of Niagara. 

^ The one now called the First Cataract. 

^ Seven mouths in ancient times, which have now dwindled down to 
two of any importance, the Damietta mouth on the east, and the Rosetta 
on the west.

either that its waters are driven back by the Etesian winds \ 
which are blowing at this season of the year from an oppo- 
site direction, and that the sea which lies beyond is driven 
into the mouths of the river ; or else that its waters are 
swollen bv the summer rains of ^Ethiopia^, wnich fall from 
the clouds conveyed thither by the Etesian winds from 
other parts of the earth. Tim«us the mathematician has 
alleged a reason of an occult nature : he says that the source 
of the river is known by the name of Phiala, and that the 
stream buries itself in channels underground, where it sends 
forth vapoms generated by the heat among the steaming 
rocks amid which it conceals itself; but that, during the days 
of the inundation, in consequence of the sun approaching 
nearer to the earth, the waters are drawn forth by the 
influence of his heat, and on being thus exposed to the 
air, overflow ; after which, in order that it may not be 
utterly di'ied up, the stream hides itself once more. He 
says that this takes place at the rising of the Dog-Star, 
when the sun enters the sign of Leo, and stands in a vertical 
position over tlie source of the river, at which time at 
that spot there is no shadow throwai. Most authors, however, 
are of opinion, on the contrary, that the river flows in greater 
volume when the sun takes his departure for the north, which 
he does when he enters the signs of Cancer and Leo, because 
its waters then are not dried up to so great an extent ; while 
on the other hand, wlien he returns towards the south pole and 
re-enters Capricorn, its waters are absorbed by the heat, 
and consequently flow in less abundance. If there is 
any one inclined to be of opinion, with Timseus, that the 
waters of the river may be drawn out of the earth by the 
heat, it will be as well for him to bear in mind the fact, that 
the absence of shadow is a phsenomenon which lasts conti- 
nuously^ in these regions. 

^ The Etesians are periodical winds, which blow steadily from one 
qiiarter for forty days each year, during tlie season of the Dog-days. 
The opinion here stated was that promulgated by Thales the pliilosopher. 
Seneca refutes it in B. iv. c. 2. of his Qurest. Nat. 

2 This was the opinion of Democritus of Abdera, and of Agathar- 
cliidas of Cnidos. It is combated by Diodorus Siciilus, B. i., but it is 
the opinion most generally received at the present day. See the disqui- 
sition on the subject introduced in the Ninth book of Lucan's Pharsalia. 

3 And that the high tide or inundation would be cousequently con- 
tinuous as well. 



414 pltnt's natural histoet. [Book V. 

The Nile begins to increase at tlie next new moon after 
tHe summer solstice, and rises slowly and gradually as the 
sun passes through the sign of Cancer ; it is at its greatest 
height while the sun is passing through Leo, and it falls as 
slowly and gradually as it arose while he is passing through 
the sign of Virgo. It has totally subsided between its 
banks, as we learn from Herodotus, on the hundredth day, 
when the sun has entered Libra. While it is rising it has been 
pronounced criminal for kings or prefects even to sail upon 
its waters. The measure of its increase is ascertained by 
means of wells^ Its most desirable height is sixteen cubits^ ; 
if the waters do not attain that height, the overflow is not 
universal ; but if they exceed that measure, by their slowness 
in receding they tend to retard the process of cultivation. 
In the latter case the time for sowing is lost, in consequence 
of the moisture of the soil ; in the former, the ground is so 
parched that the seed-time comes to no purpose. The country 
has reason to make careful note of either extreme. When 
the water rises to only twelve cubits, it experiences the 
horrors of famine ; when it attains thirteen, hunger is still 
the result ; a rise of fourteen cubits is productive of glad- 
ness ; a rise of fifteen sets all anxieties at rest ; while an 
increase of sixteen is productive of unbounded transports of 
joy. The greatest increase known, up to the present time, 
is that of eighteen cubits, which took place in the time 
of the Emperor Claudius ; the smallest rise was that of five, 
in the year of the battle of Pharsalia^, the river by this

the frontiers of jEtliiopia ; that is the name of a peninsula a 
mile in circumference, upon which Castra^ is situate, on the 
side of Arabia. Opposite to it are the four islands of 
PhiliB^, at a distance of 600 miles from the place where 
the Nile divides into two channels ; at which spot, as 
we have already stated, the Delta, as it is called, begins. 
This, at least, is the distance, according to Artemidorus, 
who also informs us that there were in it 250 towns ; Juba 
says, however, that the distance between these places is 400 f 
miles. Aristocreon says that the distance from Elephantis 
to the sea is 750 miles ; Elephantis^ being an inhabited 
island four miles below the last Cataract, sixteen"* beyond 
Syene, 585 from Alexandria, and the extreme limit of the 
na\ngation of Egypt. To such an extent as this have the 
above-named authors* been mistaken! This island is the 
place of rendezvous for the vessels of the -Ethiopians : they 
are made to fold up^, and the people carry them on their 
shoulders w^henever they come to the Cataracts. 

just below the First Cataract, and was looked upon as the southern 
frontier city of Egypt against j^thiopia. It was an important point in 
the geography and astronomy of the ancients ; for, lying just under the 
tropic of Cancer, it was chosen as the place through wliich they drew 
their chief parallel of latitude. The sim was vertical to Syene at tho 
time of the summer solstice, and a well was 8ho^vn there where the face 
of the sun was seen at noon at that time. Its present name is Assouan 
or Ossouan. 

^ If tliis word means the " Camp," it does not appear to be known 
what camp is meant. Most editions have "Cerastse," in wliich case it 
would mean that at Syene the Cerastes or horned serpent is foimd. 

2 One of these (if indeed PhUfC did consist of more than a single 
island, which seems doubtful) is now known as Djeziret-cl-Birbc, tho 
"Island of the Temple." 

3 Tliis island was seated just below the Lesser Cataract, opposite Syene, 
and near the western bank of the Nile. At this point the river becomes 
navigable downward to its mouths, and the traveller from Meroe or 
Ethiopia enters Egyjit Proper. The original name of this island was 
" Ebo," Eb being in the language of hieroglyphics the symbol of tbe ele- 
phant and ivory. It was remarkable for its fertility and verdure, and 
the Arabs of the present day designate the island as Djesirct-el-Sag, or 
" the Blooming." 

* This is a mistake of Pliny's, for it was opposite to Syene. Brotier 
thinks that Pliny intended to write ' Philaj,' but by mistake inserted Syene.

CHAP. 11. — THE CITIES OE EGYPT. 

Egypt, besides its boast of extreme antiquity, asserts tbat 
it contained, in the reign of King Amasis\ 20,000 inhabited 
cities : in our day they are still very numerous, though no 
longer of any particular note. Still however we find the 
following ones mentioned as of great renown — the city of 
Apollo^ ; next, that of Leucothea^ ; then Grreat Diospolis'*, 
otherwise Thebes, known to fame for its hundred gates ; 
Coptos^, which from its proximity to the Nile, forms its 
nearest emporium for the merchandise of India and Arabia ; 
then the town of Venus®, and then another town of Jupi- 

* The last king of the line of Psammetichus, B.C. 569. He succeeded 
Apries, w'hom the Egyptians put to death. He died just before the in- 
vasion by Cambyses, having displayed great abihties as a ruler. 

2 There was the Greater ApoUinopohs, the modem Edfoo, in the 
Thebaid, on the western bank of the Nile, in lat. 25° north, about thirteen 
miles below the lesser Cataract : its inhabitants were enemies of the cro- 
codile and its worshippers. The remains of two temples thex'e are con- 
sidered second only to the temple of Denderah as specimens of the sacred 
structures of Egyj^t. A Lesser ApoUinopolis was in Upper Egypt, on 
the western bank of the Nile, in lat. 27° north. Another Lesser Apol- 
linopoHs was a town of the Thebaid in the Coptite Nome, in lat. 26° 
north, situate between Thebes and Coptos. It was situate at the pre- 
sent Kuss. 

3 Its site is unknown. Hardouin suggests that it is the Eilethuia of 
Ptolemy, the modern El-Kab. 

^ " City of Jupiter," the Grreek name for Thebes, the No or No Ammon 
of Scripture. It stood in the centre of the Thebaid, on both banks of the 
Nile, above Coptos, and in the Nomos Coptites. Its ruins, which are the 
most magnificent in the world, enclose within their site the four villages 
of Camac, Luxor, Medinet Abou, and Gournou. 

^ Its hieroglyphical name was Kobto, and its site is now occupied by 
the modern town of Kouft or Keft. It was situate in lat. 26° north, 
on the right bank of the Nile, about a mile from its banks. As a halting 
place or rather watering-place for the caravans, it was enriched by the 
commerce between Libya and Egypt on the one hand, and Arabia and 
India and Egypt on the other, the latter being carried on through the 
port of Berenice on the Red Sea, founded by Ptolemy Philadelphus, 
B.C. 266. In the seventh century of the Christian era, it bore for some 
time the name of Justinianopolis. There are a few remains of Eoman 
buildings to be seen on its site. 

^ Also called Aphrodite or Aphroditopolis. Of this name tliere 
were several towns or cities in ancient Egypt. In Lower Egypt there 
was Atarbechis, thus named, and a town mentioned by Strabo in the 
aome of Leontopolites. In the Heptanomis or Middle Egypt there was

which is situate iu Libya^ at a distance from the river of 
seven miles and a half. Next to it comes Ptolemais^, then 
Panopolis^, and then another town of Venus ^, and, on the 
Libyan side, Lycon^, where the mountains form the boun- 
dary of the pro^dnce of Thebais. On passing these, we come 
to the towns of Mercury^", Alabastron^\ the town of 

the place, the ruins of which are called Aftyeh, on the east side of the

poHtes, and that one the ruins of which are now called Deir, on the west

Nomos Thinites, and was situate in lat. 26° 10' north and long. 32° 3' 
east. In the Thebaid it ranked next to Thebes itself. Here according 
to general belief was the bui'ial-place of Osiris. In the tune of Strabo it 
had sunk into a mere village. Its ruins, though neai'ly buried in thr 
sand, are very extensive. There is, however, some imcertainty as to the 
exact identity of This with Abydus.

its ancient Egyptian name. It was the cliicf town of the nome of Pano-

Priapus.

eastern bank of the Nile, in lat. 27° 51' north. It was the capital of 
tlie Hermoi)ohte nome in the Hc})tanomis. It was a place of great 
opulence and densely populated. The deities Typhon and Thoth were 
principally worshipped at this place. Tlio latter, the inventor of tlie 
pen and letters, nearly corresponded with the Hermes of the Greeks (the

Lower Egypt. 

2 In C. 9, when speaking of the nome of Heracleopohtes ; of which 
nome, tliis place, called Heracleopohs, was the capital. It was situate at 
the entrance of the valley of tlie Fayoum, on an island formed by the 
Nile and a canal. After Memphis and Hehopohs it was probably the 
most important city north of the Thebaid. It furnished two dynasties 
of kings to Egypt. The ichneumon was worshipped here, from which it 
may be inferred that the people were hostile to the crocodile. Its ruius 
are inconsiderable ; the village of Anasieh covers part of them. 

3 The capital of the nome of Arsinoites, seated on the western bank of 
the Nile, between the river and Lake Moeris, south-west of Mempliis, m 
lat. 29° north. It was called under the Pharaohs, " the City of Croco- 
diles," from the reverence paid by the people to that animal. Its ruins 
are to be seen at Medinet-el-Fayoom or El-Fares. 

* Its magnificent ruins, known by the name of Menf and Metrabenny, 
are to be seen about ten miles above the pyramids of Gizeli. 

5 This lay beyond Lake Moeris, or Birket-el-Keroun, at a short distance 
from the city of Arsmoe. It had 3000 apartments, 1500 of which were 
imderground. The accounts given by modern travellers of its supposed 
ruins do not agree with what we have learned from the ancients respect- 
ing its arcliitectm'e and site. The purposes for wliich it was built are 
unknown. Its supposed site is called Havara. 

^ If this is not au abbreviation or corruption for Crocodilon, as Har- 
douin suggests, it may probably mean the " town of Kams," from the 
worship perhaps of that animal there.

the Great Canal which connected the river with the Red Sea, and close 
adjoining to the present overland route for travellers to India. It was 
one of the most ancient of the Egyptian cities j here the father-ia-law of

(10.) AVitli tlie greatest justice, however, we may lavish 
our praises upon Alexandria, built by Alexander tlie Great 
on the shores of the Egyptian Sea, upon the soil of Africa, 
at twelve miles' distance from the Canopic Mouth and near 
Lake Mareotis^ ; the spot having previously borne the name 
of Rhacotes. The plan of this city Avas designed by the 
architect Dinochares", who is memorable for the genius which 
he displayed in many ways. Building the city upon a wide 
space ^ of ground fifleen miles in circumference, he formed 
it in the circular shape of a Macedonian chlamys"*, uneven 
at the edge, giving it an angular projection on the right and 
left ; while at the same time he devoted one-fifth part of the 
site to the royal palace. 

Lake Mareotis, which lies on the soutli side of the city, 
is connected by a canal which joins it to the Canopic mouth, 
and serves for the purposes of communication with the in- 
terior. It has also a great number of islands, and is thirty 

Joseph exercised the office of high-priest, and here the prophet Jeremiah 
is supposed to have -vvritten his Book of Lamentations. Its priests were 
the great depositaries of the theological and historical learning of Egypt. 
Solon, Thales, and Plato were reputed each to bave visited its schools. 
According to Macrobius, Baalbec, the Syrian City of the Sun, was a 
colony from this place. It was the capital of the nome Heliopolites, 
and paid worsliip to the sun and the bull INIncvis, tlie rival of Apis. 
From Josephus we learn that after the dispersion and fall of the tribes 
of Judah and Israel, great numbers of the Jews took refuge at this place, 
forming almost one-half of its population. The ruins, which were ex- 
tremely magnificent, occupied in the twelfth centiny an area nearly three 
miles m extent. Pliny speaks of the great obelisk there, which is still 
standing. (See B. xxxvi. c. 9.) The village of Matarieh occupies a part 
of its site, and besides the obelisk of red gi'anite, there are a few remains 
of the Temple of tlie Sun.

" Or Dinocrates. lie was the architect of the new temple of Diana at 
Ephesus, which was built after the destruction of the former one by He- 
rostratus. It was this architect who formed a design for cutting Mount 
Athos into a statue of Alexander, witli a city in the right hand and a re- 
servoir of the mountain streams in the left.

Caesar. Other writers say that it is forty schceni in length, 
making the schcenum to be thirty stadia ; hence, accord-

There are also, in the latter part of the course of the Nile, 
many towns of considerable celebrity, and more especially 
those which have given their names to the mouths of the 
piver — I do not mean, all the mouths, for there are no less 
than twelve of them, as well as four others, which the people 
call the False Mouths'. I allude to the seven more famous 
ones, the Canopic^ Mouth, next to Alexandria, those of Bol- 
bitine'', Sebennys^ Phatnis^ Mendes'', Tanis^, and, last of all, 
Pelusium^ Besides the above there are the towns of Butos^'^,

geogi'aphical miles long, and rather more than 150 stadia wide. 

2 Or " Pseudostomata." These were crossed in small boats, as they 
were not navigable for ships of burden. 

3 In the Pharaonic times Canopus was the capital of the nome of 
Menelaites, and the principal harbour of the Delta. It probably owed 
its name to the god Canobus, a pitcher full of holes, with a human head, 
which was worshipped here with pecuHar pomp. It was remarkable for 
the number of its festivals and the general dissoluteness of its morals. 
Traces of its ruins are to be seen about tln-ee miles from the modem 
Aboukir. 

* Corresponding to the modern Easchid or Eosetta. It is supposed 
that tliis place was noted for its manufactory of chariots. 

* The town of Sebennys or Sebennytum, now Samannoud, gave name 
to one of the nomes, and the Sebennytic Mouth of the Nile. 

6 Or the Pathinetic or BucoUc Mouth, said to be the same as the 
modern Damietta Mouth. 

' The capital of the Mendesian nome, called by the Arabs Ochmoun. 
This mouth is now known as the Deibeh Mouth. 

^ Now called Szan or Tzan. The Tanitic Mouth, which is sometimes 
called the Saitic, is at the present day called Omm-Faredje. 

9 Its ruins are to be seen at the modern Tineh. This city in early 
times had the name of Abaris. It was situate on the eastern side of the 
most easterly mouth of the Nile, which, after it, was called the Pelusiac 
Mouth, about two miles from the sea, in the midst of morasses. Bemg 
the frontier city towards Syria and Arabia it was strongly fortified. It 
was the birth-place of Ptolemy the geographer. 

^0 Butos or Buto stood on the Sebennytic arm of the Nile near its 
mouth, on the southern shores of the Butic Lake. It was the chief seat 
of the worship of the goddess Buto, whom the Greeks identified with 
Leto or Latona. The modern Xem Kasir occupies its site.

Its site is uncertain, but Thall-Essabouah, the " Hill of the Lion," has 
been suggested. 

3 The chief town of the Athribitic nome in Lower Egypt. It stood on 
the eastei'n bank of the Tanitic branch of the IS^ile. This nome and 
town dei'ived their name from the goddess Tlu'ipliis, whom the inscrip- 
tions there and at PanopoUs designate as the " most great goddess." The 
ruins at Atrieb or Trieb, at the spot where the modem canal of Moneys 
turns off from the IS^ile, represent the ancient Athribis. They are very 
extensive, and among them are considerable remains of the Eoman era. 

■♦ Tliis was situate near the city or town of Busii-is in the Delta. The 
modem village of Bahbeyt is supposed to cover the ruins of the temple 
of Isis. 

^ The modem Busyr or Abousir, where considerable ruins of the an- 
cient city are still to be seen. It was the chief town of the nome of 
Busirites, and stood south of Sais, near the Phatnitic mouth, on the 
western bank of the Nile. This was also the name of a town in Middle 
Egypt, i:a the neighbourhood of Memphis, and represented by another 
village of the name of Abousir. Phny, B. xxxvi. c. 16, speaks of the 
Catacombs in its vicinity. 

^ The place of that name in the Delta is here meant. 

7 Probably the town of that name, otherwise called AphroditopoHs, 
in the nome of Leontopolites. 

^ The ruins of which are now called Sa-el-Hayar. It was situate in 
the Delta, on the east side of the Canopic branch of the Nile. It was the 
ancient capital of Lower Egypt and contained the palace and burial-place 
of the Pharaohs. It was tlie chief seat of the worship of the Egyptian 
goddess Neith, also known as Sais. It gave its name to the nome of 
Saites. 

3 It was situate in the Delta of Egy]")t and in the nome of Saites, 
on the eastern bank of the Canopic branch of the Nile. It Was a 
colony of the Milesians, founded probably in the reign of Amasis, 
about B.C. 550, and remained a pure Greek city. It was the only place 
in Egypt in which, in the time of the later Pharaolis, foreigners were 
permitted to settle and trade. In later times it was famous for the 
worship of Aplirodite or Venus, and rivalled Canopus in the dissolute- 
ness of its manners.

it was called Antiochia. Its length, between Cilicia and 
Arabia\ is 470 miles, and its breadth, from Seleucia Pieria^ to 
Zeugma^, a town on the Euphrates, 175. Those who make 
a still more minute division of this country will have it that 
Phoenice is surrounded by Syria, and that first comes the 
maritime coast of Syria, part of which is Idumsea and Judaea, 
after that Phoenice, and then Syria. The whole of the tract 
of sea that lies in front of these shores is called the Phoe- 
nician Sea. The Phoenician people enjoy the glory of having 
been the inventors of letters'*, and the first discoverers of the 
sciences of astronomy, navigation, and the art of war.

On leaving Pelusium we come to the Camp of Cha- 
brias", Mount Casius^, the temple of Jupiter Casius, and the 
tomb of Pompeius Magnus. Ostracine^, at a distance of 
sixty-five miles from Pelusium, is the frontier town of Ara- 

' Or Ostracine, the northern point of Arabia. 

2 This was a great fortress of Syria founded by Seleucus B.C. 300, at 
the foot of Mount Pieria and overhanging the Mediterranean, four miles 
north of the Orontes and twelve miles west of Antioch. It had fallen 
entirely to decay ia the sixth century of otu* era. There are considerable 
ruins of its harbour and mole, its walls and necropoUs. They bear the 
name of Seleukeh or Kepse. 

3 From the Greek ^evyiia, " a junction ;" built by Seleucus Nicator on 
the borders of Commagene and Cyrrhestice, on. the west bank of the 
Euphrates, where the river had been crossed by a bridge of boats con- 
structed by Alexander the Great. The modern Bumkaleh is supposed 
to occupy its site. 

^ On this svibject see B. vii. c. 57. The invention of letters and the 
first cultivation of the science of astronomy have been claimed for the 
Egy]5tians and other nations. The Tyrians were probably the first who 
applied the science of astronomy to the piu'poses of navigation. There 
is little doubt that warfare must have been studied as an art long before 
the existence of the Phoenician nation. 

5 Strabo places this between Mount Casius and Pelusium.

Lake^ becomes visible, Idumoea and Pahrstina begin. This 
lake, which some wi-iters have made to be 150 miles in circum- 
ference, Herodotus has placed at tlie foot of Mount Casius ; 
it is now an inconsiderable fen. The to^^'ns are Ehinocolura^, 
and, in the interior, Ehaphea^, Gaza, and, still more inland, 
Anthedon"*: there is rflso Mount Argaris^ Proceeding along 
the coast we come to the region of Samaria ; Asealo", a free 
town, Azotus^, the two Jamniae^, one of them in the in- 

1 Now called the Sabakat Bardowal. It lay on the coast of Egypt, 
east of Mount Casius, and it is not improbable that the boundary-line 
between Egypt and Palsestina or Idumsea ran thi'ough the middle of its 
waters. It was strongly impregnated with asphaltus, A connection 
formerly existed between it and the Mediten*anean, but this being stopped 
up, it gradually grew smaller by evaporation and is now nearly diy. 

2 The present Kulat-el-Arich or El Arish, situate at the uiouth of the 
brook El- Arish, caUed by the Scriptures the " river of Egypt." Its name 
signifies in Gi-eek, "cutting off' of noses," and is probably derived fi*om 
the fact of its having been the place of exile for criminals who had been 
so mutilated, imder the ^Ethiopian kings of Eg;\"pt. Poinsinet suggests 
however that the name means the " to^^^l of the circumcised." 

3 The place on its site is still caUed Kefah, but it was really situate on 
the coast. Gaza has been already mentioned in a Note to C. 12, p. 423. 

&lt; Anthedon was on the coast of Palestine, altliough Pluiy says to the 
contrary. It was situate about three miles to the south-west of Gaza, 
and was destroyed by ^Uexander Jannaeus. In the time of Julian it was 
addicted to the worship of Astarte, the Syrian Venus. Accordhig to 
Dupinet the present name of its site is Daron. 

5 Brotier says that this is the same as the Mount Gerizim of Scrip- 
ture, but that was situate in Samaria, a considerable distance fi-ora the 
southern coast of Palaestina. Phny is tlic only author that mentions it. 

^ The Ascalon of Scripture, one of the five cities of the Philistines, 
situate on the coast of the Mediterranean, between Gaza and Jamnia. 
In early times it was the seat of the worship of Derceto, a fish with a 
woman's head. The ruins, which still bear the name of Askidan, are very 
extensive, and indicative of great strength. The shalot or scallion was 
originally a native of this place, and thence derived its name. 

7 The Ashdod of Scripture. It was one of the five cities of tlie Phi- 
listines and the chief seat of the worsliip of Dagon. Herodotus states 
that it stood a siege of twenty-nine years from Psammetiehus, king of 
Egypt. It was afterwards taken and retaken several times. It was 
eituate between Ascalon and Janmia, and its site is indicated by the 

' modem village of Esdad, but no ruins of the ancient city are visible. 

8 One of these was a city of the PhiHstines, assigned to the tribe of 
Judah in the fifteenth Cha))ter of Joshua, iri, uccorduiv to the Septua- 
gint version, but omitted in the Hebrew, which only mentions it in

terior ; and Joppe\ a city of the Phoenicians, which existed, 
it is said, before the deluge of the earth. It is situate on 
the slope of a hill, and in front of it lies a rock, upon which 
they point out the vestiges of the chains by which Andro- 
meda was bound^. Here the fabulous goddess Ceto^ is 
worshipped. Next to this place comes Apollonia^, and 
then the Tower of Strato^, otherwise Csesarea, built by 

2 Chron. xxvi. 6 (where it is called Jabneh in the EngHsh version), as one 
of the cities of the Pliilistines taken and destroyed by King Uzziah. The 
place of this name that lay in the interior, is probably the one spoken of 
by Josephus as in that part of tlie tribe of Judah occupied by the cliildren 
of Dan, as also in the 1 Maccabees, x. 69-71. The one was probably the 
port of the other. The ruins of the port still retain the name of Yebora, 
and are situate on an eminence about an hour's distance from the sea, on 
the banks of the river Rubin. 

^ Or Joppa of Scripture, now called Yafa or Jaffa. The timber from 
Lebanon intended for both the first and second Temples was landed here. 
It was taken and retaken more than once dm'ing the wars of the Macca- 
bees, and was finally amaexed by Pompey to the Roman province of Syria. 
It is mentioned several times in the New Testament in coimection with 
Saint Peter. In the Jewish war, having become a refuge for pirates, it 
was taken by Cestius and destroyed, and even the very ruins were de- 
mohshed by Yespasian. It was afterwards rebuilt, and in the time of the 
Crusades was alternately in the hands of the Christians and the Moslems. 

2 To be devom-ed by the sea monster, ft'om which she was dehvered 
by Perseus, who had borrowed for the occasion the talaria or winged 
shoes of Mercury. In B. ix. c, 4, Pliny states that the skeleton of the 
monster was exhibited at Rome by M. ^mihus Scamais, when he was 
Curule ^dile. 

3 Probably the same as Derceto or Atargatis, the fish-goddess with a 
woman's head, of the Syrians. 

* Situate between Csesarea and Joppa. It is probable that it owed its 
name to the Macedonian kings of either Egypt or Syria. Arsuf, a de- 
serted village, but which itself was of considerable importance in the time 
of the Crusades, represents the ancient Apollonia. 

5 The site of the Turris Stratonis was afterwards occupied by Csesarea, 
a city on the coast, founded by Herod the G-reat, and named Ctesarea in 
honom* of Augustus Caesar. It was renowned for the extent and magni- 
ficence of its harbour, wliich was secured by a breakwater of stupendous 
construction. For some time it was considered the principal city of 
Palestine and the chief seat of the Roman government. Although it 
again changed its name, as Pliny states, it still retained its name of 
Csesarea as the Metropohtan See of the First Palestine. It was also of 
considerable importance during the occupation of the Iloly Land by the 
Crusaders. Its ruins are still visible, but have served as a quarry for 
many generations, and Jaffa, Sidon, Acre and Beyrout have been sup-

CHAP. 15. (11.) — JUD^A. 

Beyond Idumsea and Samaria, Judsea extends far and 
wide. That part of it which joins up to Syria^ is called 
GalilcTa, while that which is nearest to Arabia and Egypt 
bears the name of Per^ea*'. This last is thickly covered with 
rugged moimtains, and is separated from the rest of Judaea 
by the river Jordanes. The remaining part of Judrea is 
divided into ten Toparchies, which we will mention in the 
following order : — That of Hiericus^, covered with groves of 

plied with stones from tliis site. Massive remains of its mole or break- 
water and its towers still exist. ^ Or Phoenicia. 

- By some regarded as the Scriptural town of Sichem, but by others 
as a distinct place, though in its immediate vicinity. Its present name is 
Naplous or Nabolos, situate between Mounts Ebal and Gerizun. Its 
proper name under tlie Romans was Flavia Neapolis. It was the birth- 
place of Justin iVIartyr. 

3 The city of Samaria, so called from Shemer, the owner of the hill 
wliich Omri, King of Israel, puveliased, about B.C. 922, for its site. Herod 
greatly renovated tliis ciry, wliich he called Sebaste, in honour of liis pa- 
tron Augustus, in Greek" Sebastos." Its site is now occupied by a poor 
village, which bears the name of Sebustieh. 

* A town of Palaestina, frequently mentioned by Josephus as remarkablo 
for the strength of its fortifications, and situate on the Lake Tiberias, 
opposite to Tarichtea. After a spirited defenci', it was taken by Ves])asian, 
who slaughtered lOOO of the survivors, upon which 5000 tluTW themselves 
from the walls, and were dashed to pii'ces below. The site had been for- 
gotten for nearly eighteen centuries, when Lord Lindsay discovered it on 
a lofty luU on the cast of Lake Tiberias, and nearly opposite the town of 
that name. It is now called El-Hossn, and the ruins of the fortifications 
arc very extensive. * Autiochian Syria. 

^ Pera-a was the general name of tliat part of Palirstina which lay cast 
of the river Jordan ; but more usually, in a restricted sense, it signilied 
a part only of that region, namely the district between the rivers Hiero- 
max on the north, and Anion on the south.

but of the East, and Herodium^, with a celebrated town 
of the same name. 

(15.) The river Jordanes^*^ rises from the spring of Panias", 
which has given its surname to Csesarea, of which we shall 

pakn-grove, which was presented by Antony to Cleopatra. A Bedomn 
encampment called Eiha is all that now occupies its site. 

1 A city eight or ten miles from the village Emmaiis of the New Tes- 
tament. It was called NicopoHs, in commemoration, it has been sug- 
gested, of the destruction of Jerusalem. Its site is still marked by a 
village called Ammious, on the road from Jerusalem to Jaffa. 

2 So often mentioned in the New Testament. Tliis town lay to the 
S.E. of Joppa, and N.W. of Jerusalem, at the junction of several roads 
which lead Irom the sea-coast. It was destroyed by the Komans in the 
Je^vlsh war, but was soon after rebuilt, and caUed Diospohs. A village 
called Lud occupies its site. 

3 So caUed from Acrabbim, its chief town, situate nine mHes from 
JNicopohs. The toparchy of Acrabbim, which formerly formed part of 
Samaria, was the most northerly of those of Juda?a. 

_ * Situate in the country of Benjamui. Josephus reckons it second in 
miportance only to Jerusalem, from which, according to Eusebius, it was 
distant fifteen miles, on the road to the modern Nablous. That author 
also identifies it with the Eshcol of Scriptm-e. Its site is marked by a 
small Christian village, called by the natives Jufna. 

5 Like the two precetling ones, this toparchy for a long time belono-ed 
to Samaria. Thamna, or Thamnis, was the Thnnath-Serah in Momit 
Ephraim, mentioned in Joshua xix. 50, and xxiv. 30, as the place where 
Joshua was buried. 

6 The toparchy of Bethleptepha of other authors. It appears to 
have been situate m the south of Judaea, and in that part wliich is br 
Josephus commonly caUed Idumcea. Eeland has remarked, that the 
name resembles Beth-lebaoth, a city of the tribe of Shneon, mentioned 
m Joshua xix. 6. 

From the Greek, meaning the "mountain district," or the "hill 
country," as mentioned in Luke i. 39.

about sixty stadia from Jerusalem, and not far from Tekoa. Its site has 
been identified by modern traveUers ^^-ith El-Furedis, or the Paradise • 
probably the same as the spot caUed the "Frank Mountain," on the 
top oi which the ruined waUs of the fortress are still to be seen.

so far as the situation of the localities will allow of, winds 
along- in its course and lingers among the dwellers upon 
its banks. "With the greatest reluctance, as it were, it 
moves onward towards Asphaltites^, a lake of a gloomy and 
unpropitious nature, by which it is at last swallowed up, 
and its bepraised waters are lost sight of on being mingled 
with the pestilential streams of the lake. For this reason 
it is that, as soon as ever the valleys through which it runs 
aftbrd it the opportimity, it discharges itsell' into a lake, by 
many writers known as Genesara^, sixteen miles in lengtli 
and six wide ; which is skirted by the pleasant to^vns of 
Jidias^ and Hippo^ on the east, of Tarichea'' on the south 
(a name which is by many persons given to the lake itself), 
and of Tiberias^ on the west, the hot springs^ of which are 
so conducive to the restoration of health. r

Plain were swallowed up.

sareth, or Chinnereth. It is now called the Sea of Tabariah, or Tabarieh. 

* Tlie one of the two Bethsaidas, which was situate on the north of 
the Sea of Tiberias. It was enlarged by Pliilip the Tctrarch, who greatly 
beautified it, and changed its name to Jidias, in honour of the daugliter 
of Augustus, the wife of Tiberius. It is generally supposed by the 
learned world, that this was not the Bethsaida mentioned so often in tlio 
New Testament. Its ruins are probably those now seen on a liill called 
Et-TeU, on the north-western extremity of the lake. 

'"' On the east of the lake. From it the district of Hippene took its 
name. 

' Its ruins arc to be seen at El-Kereh, on the south side of the Jake. 
It was strongly fortified, and made a vigorous resistance agamst tho

of the Hebrew name Ilammath. Dr. Robinson, in his Biblical Re-

animals will not siuk^ in its waters, and even those of bulls

six. Arabia of the JSTomades^ faces it on the east, and 
Machaerus on the south ^, at one time, next to Hierosoljma, 
the most strongly fortified place in Judaea. On the same 
side lies Callirrhoe'', a warm spring, remarkable for its me- 
dicinal qualities, and which, by its name, indicates the cele- 
brity its waters have gained.

stances, -which in ordinary water would sink immediately, will float on 
the surface of this lake. It has been suggested, that the story here 
mentioned arose from the circumstance of the name of ' bulls,' or ' cows,' 
having been applied by the ancient Nabatsei to the large masses of 
asphaltum which floated on its siirface. 

2 Ihe country of the Arabian Scenitse, or " tent people." 

2 It lay on the east of the Dead Sea, and not the south, as here men- 

ioned by PUny, being a border fortress m the south of Persea, and on 

oie confines of the Nabatsei. There was a tradition that it was at this 

place that John the Baptist was beheaded. The city now bears the 

name of Mascra. 

** A Greek name, signifying the " Fine Stream." These were warm. 
springs, situate on the eastern side of Jordan, to wliich Herod the Great 
resorted during liis last iUness, by the advice of his physicians. The 
valley of Callirhoe was visited by Captains Irby and Mangles in 1818, 
and an interesting account of it is to befound in their 'Travels,' pp. 467-469. 
Tlie waters are sulphureous to the taste. 

^ The Essenes, or Hessenes. These properly formed one of the great 
sects into which the Jews were divided in the time of Christ. They are 
not mentioned by name in the New Testament, but it has been con- 
jectured that they are alluded to in Matt. xix. 12, and Col. ii. 18, 23. 
As stated here by Pliny, they generally lived at a distance from large 
towns, in communities which bore a gi'eat resemblance to the monkish 
societies of later times. They sent gifts to the Temple at Jerusalem, 
but never ojQPered sacrifices there. They were divided into four classes, 
according to the time of their uiitiation. Thefr origin is uncer- 
tain. Some writers look upon them as the same as the Assidians, or 
Chasidim, mentioned in 1 Maccabees, ii, 42, vii. 13. Their principal 
society was probably the one mentioned by Pliny, and from this other 
smaller ones proceeded, and spread over Palestine, Sp'ia, and Egypt. 
The Essenes of Egyjjt were divided into two sects ; the practical 
Essenes, whose mode of life was the same as those of Palestine ; and the 
contemplative Essenes, who were called Tlierapeutcs.. Both sects main-

people that live apart from the world, and marvellous beyond 
all others tlirougliout the whole earth, for they have no women 
among tliem ; to sexual desire they are strangers ; money 
they have none ; the palm-trees are their only companions. 
Day after day, however, their numbers are fully recruited by 
multitudes of strangers that resort to them, driven thither 
to adopt their usages by the tempests of fortune, and wearied 
with the miseries of life. Thus it is, that through thousands 
of ages, incredible to relate, this people eternally prolongs 
its existence, without a single birth takmg place there ; so 
fruitful a source of population to it is tliat weariness of 
life wliich is felt by others. Below this people was for- 
merly the town of Engadda\ second only to Hierosolyma in 
the fertility of its soil and its groves of palm-trees ; now, 
like it, it is another heap of ashes. 'Next to it we come to 
Masada-, a fortress on a rock, not far from Lake Asphaltites. 
Thus much concerning Judaea. 

CHAP. 16. (18.) — DECAPOLIS. 

On the side of Syria, joining up to Judrea, is the region 
of Decapolis^, so called from the number of its cities ; as to 
which all writers are not agreed. Most of them, however, 
agree in speaking of Damascus'* as one, a place fertilized 

tained the same doctrines ; but the latter were distinguished bv a more 
rigid mode of hfe. It has been suggested by Taylor, the editor of 
' Cabnet's Dictionary of the ]3ibk^,' tliat John the Baptist belonged to 
this sect. 

^ Or Engedi. Its ancient name was ITazozon-Tamar, when it was 
inhabited by the Amorites. See Gen. xiv. 7 ; 2 Clu'on. xx. 2. Accord- 
ing to Josephus, it gave name to one of the fifteen toparchies of Judtea. 
It still retains its name, Ain-Jedey, or " Fountain of the Goats," and 
was so called from a spring wliich issued out of the limestone rock at tho 
base of a lofty clilT. 

^ Its site is now known as Scbbch, on the south-west of the Dead Sea. 

3 Af/cct TToXets, the "Ten Cities." lie alludes to the circumstance, 
that the number of cities varied from time to time in tliis district; 
one being destroyed in warfare, and others suddenly rising fi'om its 
foundation. 

^ The capital city of Syria, both in ancient and modem times. It is 
now called Ks-Sham. The only c]nthet given to it by the ancient \)Octa 
is that of " ventosa," or " wuulv," found in the I'harsalia of Luean, 13. iii.

mentioned by Abulfeda under the name of Eafaniat. WiUiam of Tyre 
says, that it was taken in the year 1125 by the Cotmt of Tripoh. 

4 Previously called Beth-shan. It was the next city of the DecapoHs 
in magnitude after Damascus. It was situate La the land of the tribe of 
Issachar, though it belonged to the Manasites. At this place the bodies 
of Said and his sons were hung up by the Philistines ; see 1 Sam. xxxi. 
10-12. Reland siiggests that it received the name of Scythopohs, not 
from a Scythian colony, but from the Succoth of Gi-en. xxxiii. 17, which 
appears to have been in its vicuiity. Its ruins, which still bear the name 
of Baisan, are very extensive.

south-east of the Sea of GaUlee, are very extensive.

s Also called Butis. It was the most southerly of the ten cities which 
comprised the Decapolis, standing about five miles south of Scythopohs, 
or Beth-shan. Its exact site seems not to have been ascertamed ; but it 
has been suggested that it is the modem El-Bujeh. Fi'om. the expression 
iised by Phny, it would appear to have had mineral waters in its vicuiity. 

9 Of this place notliing is known ; but it is most probable that the 
Oerasa of Ptolemy and Josephus is meant. According to the former 
writer, it was thfrty-five miles from PeUa. Its site is marked by ex- 
tensive ruLas, tliirty-five miles east of the Jordan, known by the name 
of Gerash, and on the borders of the Great Desert of the Hauvan. Ac-

between Antilibanus and the mountains of Arabia. It was bounded on 
the north by the territory of Damascus, on the east by Auranitis, on the

its ranges of rocky mountains, or rpax^j^es, the caves in which gave 
refuge to numerous bands of robbers. 

2 So called from the momitain of that name. Csesarea PhiUppi also 
bore the name of Panias. It was situate at the south of Momit Hermon, 
on the Jordan, just below its source. It was built by Phihp the Tetrarch,

famous for the worship paid by its inhabitants to Astai'te, the Syrian 
Aphrodite. A temple was erected here to Alexander the Great, in 
wliich Alexander Severus, the Roman Emperor, was born. Ids parents

name Acre, and the French St. Jean d' Acre. The earhest mention of it 
is in the Book of Judges, i. 31. It is supposed that it was Ptolemy I., 
the son of Lagus, who enlarged it and gave it the name of Ptolemais. 
Its citadel, however, still retained the name of Ace. Under the. Komans, 
Ptolemais, as mentioned by Pliny, was a colony, and belonged to G-alilee.

which extends 1500 stadia, as far as Simyra ; this district 
has the name of Coele Syria. Opposite to this cliain, and 
separated from it by an intervening valley, stretches away 
the range of Antilibanus, which was formerly connected 
with Libanus^ by a wall. Beyond it, and lynig in the in- 
terior, is the region of Decapolis, and, with it, the Tetrarchies 
already mentioned, and the whole expanse of Palaestina. On

CHAP. 18. — STEIA ANTIOCHIA. 

Here Phoenicia ends, and Syria recommences. The towns 

situate at the foot of Lebanon. The ancient name seems to have been 
Gebal, and tlie Geblites are mentioned in Joshua, xiii. 5 ; 1 Kings, v. 18 ; 
and Ezek. xxvii. 9. The ruins of the ancient city are very extensive. 
Astarte and Isis seem to have been worshipped here. 

1 Now Batrun, a small town about twelve miles north of Byblus, said 
to have been founded by Ithobal, king of Tyre. 

2 Now Gazir, according to D'AnviUe. 

3 Twelve miles from Tripohs. Its name would seem to bear reference 
to a trireme, or galley. It has been said that this is the place referred to 
in the Book of Daniel, xi. 30. 

4 Polybius speaks of this place as being burnt by Antiochus. Its site 
still beai-s the name of Calamon, according to D'AnviUe. 

5 This properly consisted of three distinct cities, 600 feet apart, each 
with its own walls, but all connected in a common constitution ; having 
one place of assembly, and forming in reality one city only. They were 
colonies,, as here suggested by PHny, of Tyre, Sidon, and Arados respec- 
tively. It is still a considerable place, called Tarabolos, or Tarablis, by 
the Turks. 

6 Its site is stiU known as Ortosa, or Tortosa. 

^ Probably the same as the Nalu'-el-Kebir, or " Great River," to the 
north of Tripolis. It may have derived its Greek name, which signifies 
"free," from its similarity to that given to it by the people of the 
countrv. 

8 This was an important city, near Antarados. Its nuns are spoken 
of as very extensive. Simyra is stiU caUed Sumira. 

" Now called Ruad ; an island off the northern coast of Phoenicia, at 
a distance of twenty stadia from the mainland, Pliny falling short here 
in his measurement. The city of Arados was very populous, though 
built on a mere rock ; and, contrary to Eastern custom, the houses con- 
tained many stories. It is spoken of by the prophet Ezekiel under the 
name of Arvad : see c. xxvii. 8, 11. In importance, it ranked next to 
the cities of Tyre and Sidon. 

^^ Its modern name does not appear to be known.

are, Cariie\ Balanea^, Paltos', and Gabale^ ; then the pro- 
montory upon which is situate the free town of Laodicea* ; 
and then Diospolis^ Heraclea^, Charadrus^, and Posidium®. 
(21.) AVe then come to the Promontory of Syria Antio- 
chia. In the interior is the free city of Antiochia'" itself, 
surnamed Epidaphnes", and divided by the river Orontes'^. 

^ Also called Antarados, as lying nearly opposite to the city of Arados. 
According to Strabo, the port of Antarados was called Came, or Camos. 
In the time of the Crusades, it was known under the name of Tortosa. 
Its present name is Tartus. 

' Now Banias. It was situate twenty-four miles north of Antarados. 
Its name is supposed to have originated in the baths in its vicinity. 
The site is deserted ; but a few ruins of the ancient town are still to 
be seen. 

3 Eight miles from Balanea. Its ruins are known by the name of Boldo. 

* Its site is now known as Djebeleh, a small village m the vicinity of 
Laodicea, or Latakia. The sun was probably worshipped here, and 
hence the Emperor Heliogabalus derived his name. 

* About fifty miles south of Antioch, now called Ladikiyeh, or Latakia, 
noted for the excellence of its tobacco, which has an European reputation. 
It was built by Seleucus I., on the site of an earlier city, called Kamitha. 
It was afterwards greatly favoured by Juhus Casar. Herod the Great 
built an aqueduct liere, tlie ruins of which are still in existence. It is 
now a poor Turkish village ; but there are considerable remains of the 
ancient city to be seen in its vicinity. 

* It has been suggested, that Phny means the city of Lydda, in the 
tribe of Benjamin, which of course would be veiy much to the south, 
and quite out of the order in which he is proceeding. If that is not the 
place meant, this Diospolis is utterly unknown. 

7 At some miles' distance to the north of Laodicea. Pococke found 
some traces of its site at a spot called Minta Baurdeleh, or the Bay of 
the Tower. 

* Phny is in error here most probably, and is sjieaking of a place aa 
being in Syria which in reahty was inCilicia, between Plat anus andCragus. 
The name imphes its situation near a mountain torrent. 

9 On a small bay, some miles north of lieraclea. 

^^ Or Antioch, the capital of the Greek kings of Syria, and the most 
famous of the sixteen cities built by Seleucus Nicator, and called after 
the name of his father, (or son, a;* some say,) Antioclius. It was built on 
the Orontes, and formed one of tlie most beautiliil and ])liasant cities of 
the ancient world. The modern Antakieh is a ])oor town, built on the 
north-western part of the site of the ancient city, by the river. The 
walls, built by Justinian, may stUl be traced for a circuit of four mUcs. 
Here the followers of our Savioiu* first obtained the name of "Christians." 

^' That is, " Near Daphne," there being a celibrated grove of that 
name, consecrated to Apollo, in its immediate vicinity. 

^2 Now called the Nahr-cl-Asy.

On the promontory is Seleucia\ called Pieria, a free city. 
(22.) Beyond it lies Mount Casius^, a different one from the 
-mountain of the same name^ which we have already mentioned. 
The height of this mountain is so vast, that, at the fourth 
watch ''of the night, you can see from it, in the midst of the 
darkness, the sun rising on the east ; and thus, by merely 
turning round, we may at one and the same time behold both 
day and night. The winding road which leads to its summit 
is nineteen miles in length, its perpendicular height four. 
Upon this coast there is the river Orontes, which takes its 
rise near Heliopolis", between the range of Libauus and An- 
tilibanus. The towns are, Ehosos^, and, behind it, the Grates 
of Syria'', lying in the space between the chain of the Rho- 
siaji mountains and that of Taurus. On the coast there is the 
town of Myriaudros^, and Mount Amanus^, upon which is the 
town of Bomitse ^°. This mountain separates Cilicia from Syria.

3 In the extreme north-east of Egypt. See pp. 422 and 424. 

'* The beginning of the fourth watch was three o'clock in the morning. 
The height of this mountain does not in reahty appear to be anything 
remarkable, and has been ascertained to be but 5318 feet. There is 
probably no foundation for the marvellous story here told by Phny ; 
nevertheless, we are told by Spartianus, that the Emperor Adrian passed 
a night upon the mountain, for the purpose of seeing this extraordinary 
Bight ; but a storm arising, it prevented the gratification of his curiosity. 
It lay near Nymphaeum and Seleucia, and its base was waslied by the 
waters of the Orontes. » Or Baalbec, in the ulterior of Syria. 

^ According to Ansart, it still retams that name. 

7 Now called Bylan. This was the name of the narrow pass between 
n portion of Mount Taurus and the Kock of Rossicuni. According to 
Ansart, the spot is called at the present day Saggal Doutan. 

^ This was a Phoenician colony, on the eastern side of the Gulf of 
Issvis ; it is said by Ansart still to retain its ancient name. 

" Now called Aima-Dagh, a branch of Mount Tam-us, running from 
the head of the Gulf of Issus, north-east, to the principal chain, and 
dividing Syria from Cilicia and Cappadocia. There were two passes in 
it, the Syrian Gates and the Amanian Gates. It is often spoken of by 
Cicero, who was the Roman governor of Cihcia.

who mentions it.

the Tetrarehy of the Nazerini^ ; Bambyx, the other name of 
whieli is Hierapolis^, but by the Syrians called Mabog\ 
(here the monster Atargatis% called Derceto by the Greeks, 
is worshipped) ; and the place called Chalcis® on the Belus'', 
from which tlie region of Chalcidene, the most fertile part of 
Syria, takes its name. We here find also CjTrhestice, with 
Cyrrhum^, the Gazatse, the Gindareni, the Gabeni, the two 
Tetrarchies called Granucomatse^, the Emeseni^", the Hyla- 

1 Now Kulat-el-!Mudik, situate in the valley of the Orontes, and capital 
of the province of Apamene. It was fortified and enlarged by Seleucus 
Nicator, who gave it its name, after his wife Apama. It also bore the 
Macedonian name of PeUa. It was situate on a hill, and was so far sur- 
rounded by the windings of the Orontes, as to become a peninsida, whence 
its name of Chersonesus. A^ery extensive nuns of this place still exist. 

^ It is suggested, that these are tlie Phylarchi Arabes of Strabo, now 
called the Nosairis, who were situate to the east of Apamea. The river 
Marsyas here mentioned was a small tributary of the Orontes, into 
wliich it falls on the east side, near Apamea. 

^ This was situate in Cyrrhestica, in Syria, on the high road from 
Antioch to Mesopotamia, twenty-four miles to the west of the Euphrates, 
and thirty-six to the south-west of Zeugma ; two and a half days' jour- 
ney from Beroea, and five from Antioch. It obtained its Greek name 
of the " Sacred City" from Seleucus Nicator, owing to its being the chief 
Beat of the worship of the Syrian goddess Astarte. Its ruins were first 
discovered by Maundrell. 

* In the former editions it is "Magog;" but Sillig's reading of 
**Mabog" is correct, and corresponds with the Oriental forms of Mun- 
bedj, Manbesja, Manbesjun, Menba, Manba, Manbegj, and the modem 
name, Kara Bambuche, or Buguk Munbedj. 

° Astarte, the semi-fish goddess, 

^ This Chalcis is supposed to have been situate somewhere in the 
district of the Buckaa, probably south of Ileliopolis, or Baalbec. It has 
been suggested, that its site may have been at, or near Zahle ; in the 
vicinity ol" whicli, at the village of Ileusn Nieba, are to be seen some 
remarkable remains. Or else, possibly, at Majdel Anjar, whore Abul- 
feda speaks of great ruins of hewn stone. 

7 Ansart suggests, that Belus is here the name of a mountain, and 
that it may be the same that is now called Djebel-il-Semmaq. 

^ To tlie north of Chalcidene, a town of Syria, on the slopes of the 
Taurus, eiglity miles to the north-cast of Antioch. In the Roman times, 
it was the head-quarters of the Tenth Legion. The ruins near the modem

Pliny assigns a desert district beyond Pahnyi'a. It was celebrated in 
ancient times for its magnificent temple of the sun, and the appointment 
of its priest, Bassianus, or HeUogabalus, to the imperial dignity, in his 
fourteenth year. It was made a colony, with the jus Italicum, by Cara- 
ealla, and afterwards became the capital of Phoenicia Libanesia. The 
present name of its site is Hems. 

^ The Hylatae are totally miknown. Itursea was situate in the north- 
east of Palestine, and, with Trachonitis, belonged to the tetrarchy of 
Phihp. Its boundaries cannot be precisely determined; but it may 
probably be traversed by a line drawn from the Lake of Tiberias to 
Damascus.

west of Emesa.

of the Euphrates, opposite to the ford of Zeugma, a fortress of con- 
siderable importance.

situate between Epiphania and Emesa. In later times, it took the 
name of Restan. 

^ The people of Beroea, a town of Syria, midway between Antioch and 
Hierapohs. Seleucus Nicator gave to it the Macedonian name of Beroea ; 
but, in A.D. 638, it resumed its ancient name of Chaleb, or Chalybon. 
The modern Haleb, or Aleppo, occupies its site. Some excavations, on 
the eastern side of it, are the only vestiges of ancient remains in the 
neighbourhood.

This place, too, will be the most appropriate one for 
making some mention of the Euphrates. This river rises in 
Caranitis^, a praefecture of Greater Armenia, according to 
the statement of tliose who have approached the nearest to 
its source. Domitius Corbulo says, that it rises in Mount 
Aba ; Licinius Mucianus, at the foot of a mountain which 
he calls Capotes'*, twelve miles above Zimara, and tliat at its 
source it has the name of Pyxurates. It first flows past 
Derxene^ and then Anaitica^, shutting out^ the regions of 
Armenia from Cappadocia. Dascusa^ is distant from Zimara 
seventy-five miles ; from this spot it is navigable as far as

Egypt, it was the south west border fortress of Syria. It was the chief 
city of a district called Laodicene. 

2 Of Leucas, or Leucadia, nothing is known. Larissa, in Syria, was 
y city in the district of Apamene, on the western bank of the Orontes, 
About half-way between Apamea and Epiphania. The site is now called

miles in width. At its passage'^ between the mountains, 
the river bears the name of Omma^ ; but afterwards, when it

^ Other readings liave "Pastona" here, said by D'Anville to be the 
modern Pastek. 

2 Called the metropoHs of Lesser Armenia by Procopius. It was 
situate between Anti-Taurus and the Euphrates, and celebrated for its 
fertility, more especially in fruit-trees, oil, and wine. The site of the 
city Mehtene is now called Malatiyah, on a tributary of the Euphrates, 
and near that river itself. 

3 It is generally supposed that " twenty-foiir " would be the correct 
reading here. 

^ There were two places of this name. The one here spoken of was a 
town of Lesser Armenia, on the right bank of the Euphrates, at the 
fu-st, or prmcipal curve, which takes place before the river enters Mount 
Taurus. It is represented by the modern Iz Oghlu. 

5 No other writer is found to make mention of the Lycus, which 
flows into the Euphrates, though there is a river formerly so called, which 
flows into the Tigris below Larissa, the modem Nimroud. D'Anville 
is of opinion, that it is formed from the numerous springs, called by the 
people of the district Bing-gheul, or the " Thousand Springs." 

^ Now called the Myrad-Chai. Ritter considers it to be the south 
arm of the Euphrates. The Arsanus is mentioned by no writer except 
Pliny. • 

7 The defile at this place is now called the Cataract of Nachour, ac- 
cording to Parisot. 

8 The more general reading here is "Omfra." Hardouin is of opinion, 
that this is the district referred to in the Book of Judith, ii. 24. In the 
Vulgate, it appears to be twice called the river Mambre; but in our 
version it is called Arhonai. 

^ Bumouf has concluded, from a cuneiform inscription which he 
deciphered, that the name of this people was Ayura, and that Hardouin 
i^s wrong in conjecturing that it was a name derived from tlie Greek 
opos, " a mountain," and designating the people as a mountain tribe. 
If Bumouf is right, the proper reading here would seem to be Aroei, or 
Arrhcsi.

schoeni^ in width, from the territory of the Commageni* on 
the right, and it admits of a bridge being thrown across it, 
even where it forces a passage through tiie range of Taurus. 
At CLaudiopolis^, in Cappadocia, it takes an easterly direc- 
tion ; and here, for the first time in this contest, Taurus 
turns it out of its course ; though conquered before, and 
rent asunder by its channel, the mountain-chain now gains 
the victory in another way, and, breaking its career, com- 
pels it to take a southerly direction. Thus is this warfare 
of nature equally waged, — the river proceeding onward to 
the destination which it intends to reach, and the mountains 
forbidding it to proceed by the path which it originally 
intended. After passing the Cataracts*, the river again 
becomes navigable ; and, at a distance of forty miles from 
thence, is Samosata^, the capital of Commagene. 

CHAP. 21. SYRIA UPON THE EUPHRATES. 

Arabia, above mentioned, has the cities of Edessa^, for- 
merly called Antiochia, and, from the name of its fountain, 
Callirhoe'^, and Carrhae^, memorable for the defeat of Crassus 

^ The lengtli of the schoenus has been mentioned bj our author in 
C. 11 of the present Book. M. Saigey makes the Persian parasang to be 
very nearly the same length as the schoenus of Phny. 

2 Commagene was a district in the north of Syria, bounded by the 
Euphrates on the east, by Cihcia on the west, and by Auianus on the 
north. Its capital was Samosata. 

3 The place here spoken of by Pliny is probably the same mentioned 
by Ptolemy as in Cataonia, one of the provinces of Cappadocia. Ac- 
cording to Parisot, the site of the place is called at the prest-nt day 
•KaClaudie.' 

* Salmasius has confounded these cataracts with those of Naehour, or 
Elegia, previously mentioned. It is evident, however, that tliey are not 
the same. 

5 Now called Someisat. In literary liistory, it is celebrated as beiiig 
the birtli-place of the satirist Lucian. IS'otliing remains of it but a lieap 
of ruins, on an artificial mound.

It was situate on the Syrtus, now the Daisan, a small tributary oi' the 
Euphrates. Phny speaks ratlier loosely when ho ])lace!» it in Arabia. 
It is supposed that it bore tlie name of Antiochia during tlie reign of 
the Syrian king, Antiochus IV. The modern town of Orl'alior rut'ali is

there. Adjoining to tliis is the prsefecture of Mesopotamia, 
which derives its origin from the Assyrians, and in which are 
the towns of Anthemusia^ and Nicephorium^ ; after which 
come the Arabians, known by the name of Prsetavi, with Sin- 
gara^ for their capital. Below Samosata, on the side of Syria, 
the river Marsyas'* flows into the Euphrates. At Cingilla 
ends the territory of Commagene, and the state of the 
Immei begins. The cities which are here washed by the 
river are those of Epiphania^ and Antiochia^, generally 
known as Epiphania and Antiochia on the Euphrates ; also 
Zeugma, seventy-two miles distant from Samosata, famous 
for the passage there across the Euphrates. Opposite 
to it is Apamia', which Seleucus, the founder of both 
cities, united by a bridge. The people who join up to 
Mesopotamia are called the E-hoali. Other towns in Syria 
are those of Europus^, and what was formerly Thapsa- 

was here, as alluded to by Pliny, that Crassus was defeated and slain by 
the Partliian general, Surena. It was situate in Osroene, in Mesopo- 
tamia, and not far from Edessa. According to Stephanus, it had its 
name from Carrha, a river of Syria, and was celebrated in ancient times 
for its temple of Luna, or Lunus. 

^ According to Strabo, the Aborras, now the Khabur, flowed round 
this town. By Tacitus it is called Anthemusias. According to Isidorus 
of Charax, it ky between Edessa and the Euplu-ates. 

2 Now Rakkah, a fortified town of Mesopotamia, on the Euphrates, 
near the mouth of the river Bilecha. It was built by order of Alexander 
the Great, and completed probably by Seleucus. It is supposed to have 
been the same place as CaUinicum, the fortifications of which were re- 
paired by Justinian. Its name was changed in later times to Leontopolis 
by the Emperor Leo. 

3 Now called Sinjar, according to Brotier. Some writers imagine 
that this was the site of " the plain in the land of Sliinar," on wliich the 
Tower of Babel was built, mentioned in the Book of Genesis, xi. 2. 

* Mentioned in C. 17 of the present Book. 

5 Probably not that in the district of Cassiotis, and on the western 
bank of the Orontes, mentioned in C. 19 of the present Book. Of this 
locahty nothing seems to be known, except that Dupinet states that it 
is now called Adelphe by the Turks. 

^ Probably the " Antiochia ad Taurum " mentioned by the geographer 
Stephanus, and by Ptolemy. Some writers place it at the modem 
Ainthb, seventy-five miles north-east of Aleppo. 

7 Now called Roum-Cala, or the "Roman Castle." For Zeugma

cus\ now Amphipolis. We then come to the Arabian 
Scenitae^. The Euphrates then proceeds in its course till 
it reaches the place called Ura^, at which, taking a turn 
to the east, it leaves the Syrian Deserts of Palmyra'*, 
which extend as far as the city of Petra* and the regions 
of Arabia Felix. 

(25.) Palmyra is a city famous for the beauty of its site, 
the riches of its soil, and the delicious quality and abundance 
of its water. Its fields are surrounded by sands on every 
side, and are thus separated, as it were, by nature from the rest 
of the world. Though placed between the two great empires 
of Eome and Parthia, it still maintains*' its independence ; 
never failing, at the very first moment that a rupture 
between them is threatened, to attract the careful attention 
of both. It is distant 337 miles from Seleucia^ of the 
Parthians, generally known as Seleucia on the Tigris, 203 
from the nearest part of the Syrian coast, and twenty-seven 
less from Damascus. 

pii3. Colonel Rawlinson has identified it with the present Yeramin, at 
no great distance fi*om the ancient Rhages. 

^ Its ruins are to be seen at the ford of El Hamman, near the modern 
Hakkah. It stood on the banks of the Euphrates ; and here was the 
usual, and, for a long time, the only ford of the Euphrates. It is sup- 
posed to have derived its name from the Aramean word " Thiphsach," 
signiJfymg " a ford." 2 Qr " DweUers in Tents." See p. 422. 

3 According to Ortehus and llardouin, tliis is the place called Sura 
by Pliny, in C. 26 of the present Book ; but Parisot diti'ers fi'om that 
opinion. Bochart suggests, that " Ur, of the Chaldees," is the place 
referred to under this name ; but, as Hardouin observes, that place lay 
at a considerable distance to the south. 

^ So called from the circumstance that Palmyra stood in tlie midst 
of them. It was built by King Solomon, in an oasis of the Desert, in 
the midst of palm groves, from which it received its Greek name, which 
was a translation also of the Hebrew " Tadmor," " the city of palm-trees." 
It lay at a considerable distance from the Euphrates. Its site presents 
considerable ruins ; but they are all of the Roman period, and greatly 
inferior to those of Baalbec or Heliopohs.

Wady-Musa, half-way between the head of the Gulf of Akabah and the 
Dead Sea.

Zenobia, by the Emperor Aurehan, in a.i&gt;. 270. It was partially de- 
stroyed by him, but was afterwards fortified by Justinian ; though it 
.never recovered its former greatness. 7 gee j}. vi. c. 30.

(26.) Eelow the deserts of Palmyra is the region of 
Stelendene\ and Hierapolis, Beroea, and Chalcis, already 
mentioned^. Beyond Palmyra, Emesa^ takes to itself a 
portion of these deserts ; also Elatium, nearer to Petra by 
one-half than Damascus. At no great distance from Sura^ 
is Philiscum, a town of the Parthians, on the Euphrates. 
Erom this place it is ten days' sail to Seleucia, and nearly 
as many to Babylon. At a distance of 5r4 miles be- 
yond Zeugma, near the village of Massice, tl e Euphrates 
divides into two channels, the left one of which runs through 
Mesopotamia, past Seleucia, and falls into the Tigris as it 
flows around that city. Its channel on the right runs towards 
Babylon, the former capital of Chalda^a, and flows through 
the middle of it ; and then through another city, the name of 
which is Otris^, after which it becomes lost in the marshes. 
Like the Nile, this river increases at stated times, and at 
much about the same period. When the sun has reached 
the twentieth degree of Cancer, it inundates® Mesopotamia ; 
and, after he has passed through Leo and entered Virgo, 
its waters begin to subside. By the time tlie sun has 
entered the twenty-ninth degree of Virgo, the river has fully 
regained its usual height.

Sura. The site of Pliiliscum is totally imknovra. 

* Notliing is known of this place. 

^ Parisot remarks, that it is true that the Euphrates increases peri- 
odically, much in the same manner as the Nile ; but that its increase 
does not arise from similar causes, nor are the same results produced by 
it, seeing that the river does not convey the same volume of water as the 
Nile, and that the country in the vicinity of its bed does not, like Egypt, 
form a valley pent up between two ranges of liills. 

' So called probably from the Greek diacpavtjs, "transparent." It 
has not been identified, but it was no doubt a small stream falling into 
the Gulf of Issus.

s The "Gulf of Issos is now called the Gulf of Scanderoon or Isken- 
derun, from the town of that name, the former Alexandria ad Issum, 
mentioned here by Pliny. In the vicinity of Issus, Alexander defeated 
the army of Darius. The exact site of the town appears not to have 
been ascertained.

Its ruins still bear the name of Tersus. During the civil war it took part 
with Julius Ca}sar, and from him received the name of Juliopolis.

of Cassipolis, or Cassiopolis according to some readings, is unknown. 

IS The sites of Thynos and Zephyrium appear to be unknown. Anchiale 
was situate on the coast, upon the river Anchiak-us, according to tho 
geographer Stephanus. Aristobulus, quoted by Strabo, says that at this 
place was the tomb of Sai-dana]ialus, and on it a relief in stone repre- 
senting a man snapj)ing the fingers of tlio riglit liand. He adds,

2 Now called the Tersoos Chai. It is remarkable for the coldness of 
its waters, and it was here that Alexander the Great nearly met with his 
death from bathing when heated, in the stream. 

3 Now Chelendreh. It was a strong place on the coast, situate on a 
high rock nearly surrounded by the sea. None of its ruins seem older 
than the early period of the Roman empire. The Turks call it Guhiare. 

•* Probably so called from a temple to the Sea Nymphs there. 

5 To distinguish it from Soles or Soh of Cyprus. It was situate be- 
tween the rivers Cydnus and Lamus, and was said to have been colonized 
by Ai'gives and Lydians from Rhodes. Alexander mulcted its inha- 
bitants of 200 talents, for their adl^esion to the Persians. It was cele- 
brated as the birth-place of the Stoic plulosopher Chrysippus, the comic 
poet Philemon, and the poet and astronomer Aratus. Its name is per- 
petuated in the word Solecism, which is said to have been first apphed to 
the corrupt dialect of Greek spoken by the mhabitants of this city, or as 
some say, of SoU in Cyprus. 

^ It still retains its ancient name, and is situate on the western side of 
the Sarus, now the Syhovm or Syhan. Pompey settled here some of the 
Cilician pirates whom he had conquered. 

"^ Leake, in his 'Asia Minor,' p. 196, says, "The vestiges of Cibyraare 
probably those observed by Captain Beaufort upon a height which rises 
from the right bank of a considerable river about eight miles to the 
eastward of the Melas, about four miles to the west of Cape Karaburnu, 
and nearly two miles from the shore." Ptolemy mentions Cibyra as aa 
inland town of Cihcia Trachea, but Scylax places it on the coast. 

8 Its ruins are still called Pinara or Mmara. It was an inland city of 
Lycia, some distance west of the river Xanthus, and at the foot of 
Mount Cragus. 

^ Or perhaps ' Podahe.' Of it nothing seems to be known. 

^° Or Sehnuntum, now Selenti, on the coast of Cilicia. In consequence 
of the death here of the Emperor Trajan, it received the name of Trajano- 
pohs. Of Ale, if that is the correct reading, nothing whatever is knovni. 

^^ On the coast of Cihcia ; mentioned by Strabo as having a port. 
Leake places it at or near the ruined castle called Sokhta Kalesi, below 
which is a port, and a peniusula on the east side of the harbour covered 
with ruins. 

'^ In the district of Selenitis. It has been identified with the site of the 
modern fortress of Lambardo. It is also suggested that it may have 
been the same place as Laerte, the native city of Diogenes Laertius. 
Of Doron nothing seems to be known.

name. Passing these, we come to the river Calycadnus^, 
the Promontory of Sarpedon*, the towns of Hulmoe* and 
Myle, and the Promontory and town of Venus^, at a short 
distance from the island of Cyprus. On the mainland there 
are the toAMis of Myanda, Anemurium^, and Coracesium*, 
and the river Melas^, the ancient boundary of Cilicia. In 
the interior the places more especially worthy of mention 
are Anazarbus^", now called Ca?sarca, Augusta, Castabala^\ 
Epiphania^-, formerly called OEniandos, Eleusa'^, Iconium^^, 

^ Its ruins are supposed to be those seen by Leake near the island of 
Ci'ambusa. Here the walls of an ancient city may still be traced, and a 
mole of unhewn rocks projects from one angle of the fortress about 100 
yards across the bay. 

2 Strabo describes this cave as a vast hollow of circular form, sur- 
rounded by a margin of rock on all sides of considerable height ; on 
descending it, the ground was found full of shrubs, both evergi-eens and 
cultivated, and in some parts the best satfron was gro■w^l. He also says 
tliat there was a cave wliich contained a large spring, from which arose a 
river of clear water which immediately afterwards sank into the earth 
and flowed miderground into the sea. It was called the Bitter Water. 
This cave, so famed in ancient times, does not appear to have been 
examined by any modern traveller. It was said to have been the bed of 
the giant Typhon or Typhoeus. ^ Now known as the Ghiuk-Su. 

* Supposed to be the same as the modem Lessan-el-Kahpeh. 

* Or Holmi, on the coast of Cilicia Tracheia, a little to the south-west 
of Seleucia. Leake thinks that the modern town of Aghaliman occupies 
the site of Holmce. 

^ Probably the same place as the Aplirodisias mentioned by Livy, Dio- 
dorus Siculus, and Ptolemy. 

7 On the headland now called Cape Anemour, the most southerly part 
of Asia Minor. Beaufort discovered on the point indications of a con- 
siderable ancient town. 

8 Its sita is now called Alaya or Alanieh. This spot was Strabo's 
boundary-line between Pamphylia and Cilicia. Some sliglit remains of the 
ancient town were seen here by Beaufort, but no inscriptions were found. 

3 Identified by Beaufort witli the modem Manaugat-Su. 
'0 So called, either from an adjacent mountain of that name, or its 

founder, Anazarbus. Its later name was Cocsarea ad Ana/.arhum. lis site is 
called Anawasy or Amnasy, and is said to display considerable reinaiTis of 
the ancient town. Of Augusta notliing is known": Ptolemy places it in a 
district called Bi'yehce. 

^^ Identified by Ainsworth with the ruins seen at Kara Kaya in Cilicia. 

^2 Pompey settled some of the Cilieian pirates here aftt-r his defeat of 
them. It was thirty miles east of Anazarbus, but its site does not appear 
to have been identiified. ^^ An island oil' the shore of Cihcia, also

All the geographers have mentioned Pamphylia as joining 
up to Cilicia, without taking any notice of the people of 
Isauria'. Its cities are, in the interior, Isaura^ Clibanus, 
and Lalasis ; it runs down towards the sea by the side of

all who have treated of this subject have been ignorant of 
the existence of the nation of the Homonades bordering upon 
Isaiu-ia, and their to\\Ti of Homona^ in the interior. There 
are forty-four other fortresses, which lie concealed amid 
rugged crags and valleys.

Its ruins are called Selefkeh. This was an important city of Seleucia 
Aspera, bililt by Seleucus I. on the western bank of the river Calycadnus. 
It had an oracle of Apollo, and annual games m honour of Zeus Olympms. 
It was a free city under the Romans. It was here that Frederick Bar-

to his new city of Seleucia. 

3 Said by Yitruvius to have had the property of anomtmg those who 
bathed in its waters. If so, it probably had its name from the Greek 
word Xnrapbs, " fat." It flowed past the town of Soloe. Bombos and 
Paradisus are rivers which do not appear to have been identified. 

■♦ A branch of the Taurus range. ^ ^ 

5 It bordered in the east on Lycaonia, in the north on Phrygia, m the 
west on Pisidia, and in the south on Cihcia and PamphyHa. 

6 A weU-fortified city at the foot of Mount Taurus. It was twice 
destroyed, first by its inhabitants when besieged by Perdiccas, and again 
by the Roman general Servihus Isauricus. Strabo says that Amyntas of. 
Galatea built a new city in its vicinity out of the rums of the old one. 
P'AnviUe and others have identified the site of Old Isauria with the:

CHAP. 24. — PISIDIA. 

The Pisidae\ formerly called the Solymi, occupy the higher 
parts of the mountains. In their country there is the colony 
of Ca?sarea, also called Antiochia", and the towns of Oro- 
anda^ and Sagalessos. 

CHAP. 25. — LTCAONIA. 

These people are bounded by Lycaonia^, which belongs to 
the jurisdiction of the province of Asia*, to which also resort 
the people of Philomelium^, Tymbrium'^, Leucolithium*, 
Pelta, and Tyrium. To this jurisdiction is also added a 

whereas Strabo speaks of them as the most barbarous of all the Pisidian 
tribes, dwelhng only in caves. They were conquered by the consul Qoi- 
rinius in the time of Augustus. 

^ Pisidia was a mountainous region formed by that part of the main 
chain of Mount Taurus which sweeps round in a semicii'cle parallel to 
the shore of the Paraphylian Gulf; the shore itself at the foot of the 
mountains forming the district of Pamphyha. On the south-east it was 
boimded by Cihcia, on the east and north-east by Lycaonia and Isauria, 
and by Phrygia Parorios on the north, where its boimdaries greatly 
varied at different times. 

2 G-enerally called " Antioch of Pisidia," was situate on the south side of 
the mountain boundary between Phrygia and Pisidia. The modem Ya- 
lobatch is supposed to occupy its site. The remains of the ancient town 
are numerous. Its title of Csesarea was probably given to it on its be- 
coming a Eoman colony early in the unperial period. 

3 D'Anville suggests that the modem Havhan occupies its site, and 
that Sadjakla stands on that of Sagalessos. 

* This coimtry was bounded on the north by Galatia, on the east by 
Cappadocia, on the south by Cilicia Aspera, on the south-west by Tsauria 
and Phrygia Parorios, and on the north-west by Great Plirygia. It 
was assigned under the Persian empire to the satra])y of Cappadocia, 
but considered by the Greek and Roman geographers the soutli-east part 
of Phrygia. 

^ Phrygia, or the western part of Asia, the first part of the Asiatic 
continent that received the name of Asia. See Chapters 28 &amp; 29 of the 
present Book. 

^ D'Anville thinks that the place called Il-Goim occupies the site of 
Pliilomela. 

7 Hardouin suggests that the reading here is "Tibriani," the people 
of Tibrias. Ansart is of opinion that Thymbrium is meant, the place at 
which Cyrus defeated the army of Cnrsus. 

8 Its site is unknown. It was probably so called from the quarries of 
white stone or marble in its vicinity. Pelta and T\ riuiu are also equally 
unknown.

The former name of Pamphylia'* was Mopsopia®. The 
Pamphylian Sea^ joins up to that of Cilicia. The towns of 
Pamphylia are Side'', Aspendum*^, situate on the side of a 
mountain, Pletenissum^, and Perga^°. There is also the Pro- 
montory of LeucoUa, the mountain of Sardemisus, and the 

1 Tconiura was regarded in the time of Xenoplion as the easternmost 
town of Phrygia, while all the later authorities described it as the prin- 
cipal city of Lycaonia. In the Acts of the Apostles it is described as a 
very populous city, uihabited by Grreeks and Jews. Its site is now called 
Kunjah or Koniyeh. 

2 It has been suggested that this may be the Tarbassus of Artemidorus, 
quoted by Strabo. Hyde was in later times one of the episcopal cities of 
Lycaonia. 

3 Their district is called Melyas by Herodotus, B. i. c. 173. The city 
of Arycanda is unknown. 

^ United with Cihcia it now forms the province of Caramania or Ker- 
manieh. It was a narrow strip of the southern coast of Asia Minor, 
extending in an arch along the Pamphylian Grulf between Lycia on the 
west, Cilicia on the east, and on the north bordering on Pisidia. 

^ Tradition ascribed the first Grreck settlements in this country to 
Mopsus, son of Apollo (or of Rhacius), after the Trojan war. 

^ Now called the Gulf of Adaha, lying between Cape KheHdonia and 
Cape Anemour. 

7 Now called Candeloro, according to D'AnviUe and Beaufort. 

8 Or Aspendus, an Argeian colony on the river Euiymedon. The 
" mountain " of Phny is notlung but a hill or piece of elevated ground. 
It is supposed that it still retains its ancient name. In B. xxxi. c. 7, 
Pliny mentions a salt lake in its vicinity. 

^ Hardouin suggests that the correct reading is 'Petnelessum.' 
^^ A city of remarkable splendour, between the rivers Catarrhaetes and 
Cestrus, sixty stadia from the mouth of the former. It was a celebrated 
scat of the worship of Artemis or Diana. In the later Roman empire it 
was the capital of Pamphyha Secunda. It was the first place visited by 
St. Paul in Asia Minor. See Acts, xiii. 13 and xiv. 25. Its splendid 
ruins are still to be seen at Murtana, sixteen miles north-east of Adaiia.

Adjoining to Painphylia is the Sea of Lycia and the conn- 
try of Lycia^ itself, where the chain of Taurus, coming from 
the eastern shores, terminates the vast Gulf ^ by the Promon- 
tory of Chelidonium''. Of immense extent, and separating 
nations innumerable, after taking its first rise at tlie Indian 
Sea^, it branches off to the north on the right-hand side, 
and on the left towards the south. Then taking a direction 
towards tlie west, it would cut through the middle of Asia, 
were it not that the seas check it in its triumphant career 
along the land. It accordingly strikes off in a northerly 
direction, and forming an arc, occupies an immense tract of 
country, nature, designedl}^ as it were, every now and then 
throwing seas in the way to oppose its career ; here the Sea 
of Phoenicia, there the Sea of Pontus, in tliis direction the 
Caspian and Hyrcanian^, and then, opposite to them, the 
Lake Mfeotis. Altliough somewhat curtailed by tliese ob- 
stacles, it still winds along between them, and makes its 

1 Now known as the Kapri-Su. 

' Now called Dudon-Su. It descends the mountains of Taurus in a 
great broken waterfall, whence its name. 

3 Probably occupying the site of the modern Atalieh or Satalieh. 

■* On the borders of Lycia and Pamphyha, at the foot of Mount 
Solyma. Its ruins now bear the name of Tekrova. 

5 It was inclosed by Coria and Pamphylia on the west and cast, and 
on tlie north by the district of Ciby rates in Phrygia. 

6 The Gulf of Sataheh or Adalia. 

7 Still kno\\-n as Cape Khelidonia or Cameroso. 

8 Parisot remarks here, " Phny describes on this occasion, witli an 
exactness vei-y remarkable for his time, the chain of mountains which 
runs through the partof Asia known to the ancients, although it is evitlent 
that he confines the extent of them within much too small a compass." 

^ The Caspian and the Ilyrcanian Seas are generally looked upon as 
identical, but we find them again distinguished by Pliny in B.vi. c. 13, 
where he says that this inland sea commences to be called ihe Caspian 
after you have passed the river Cyrus (or Kiir), and that the Cas]iii live 
near it ; and in C. IG, that it is called the Jli/rcanian Sea, from the ilyr- 
cani who live along its shores. The western side would therefore in 
strictness be called the Caspian, and the eastern the Ui/rcanian Sea.

way even amidst these barriers ; and victorious after all, ifc 
then escapes with its sinuous course to the kindred chain 
of the Ripha3an mountains. Numerous are the names 
which it bears, as it is continuously designated by new ones 
throughout the whole of its course. In the first part of its 
career it lias the name of Imaus\ after which it is known 
successively by the names of Emodus, Paropanisus, Circius, 
Gambades, Paryadres, Choatras, Oreges, Oroandes, Niphates, 
Taurus, and, where it even out-tops itself, Caucasus. Where 
it throws forth its arms as though every now and then it 
would attempt to invade the sea, it bears the names of Sar- 
pedon, Coracesius, Cragus, and then again Taurus. Where 
also it opens and makes a passage to admit mankind, it still 
claims the credit of an unbroken continuity by giving the 
name of " Gates" to these passes, which in one place are 
called the " Grates of Armenia'V in another the " Gates of the 
Caspian," and in another the " Gates of Cilicia." In addition 
to this, when it has been cut short in its onward career, it 
retires to a distance from the seas, and covers itself on the 
one side and the other with the names of numerous nations, 
being called, on the right-hand side the Hyrcanian and the 
Caspian, and on the left the Paryadrian^, the Moschian, the 
Amazonian, the Coraxican, and the Scythian chain. Among 
the Greeks it bears the one general name of Ceraunian^. 

^ "The name of Imaiis was, in the first instance, applied by the Greek 
geographers to the Hindii-Kush and to the chain parallel to the equator, 
to which the name of Himalaya is usually given at the present day. The 
name was gradually extended to the intersection running north and south, 
the meridian axis of Central Asia, or the Bolor range. The divisions of 
Asia into ' intra et extra Imaum,' were unknown to Strabo and Phny, 
though the latter describes the knot of mountains formed by the inter- 
sections of the Himalaya, the Hindii-Kush, and Bolor, by tlie expression 
'quorum (Montes Emodi) promontorium Imaiis vocatui*.' The Bolor 
chain lias been for ages, with one or two exceptions, the boundary be- 
tween the empu^es of Cliina and Turkestan." — Dr. Smith's Dictionary of 
A.ncient Geography. 

2. The Gates of Ai'menia are spoken of in B. vi. c. 12, the Gates of the 
Caspian ui C. 16 of the same Book, and the Gates of Cihcia in C. 22 of 
the present Book. 3 ggg q i^. of tlie next Book. 

"* " Strabo gives this name to only the eastern portion of the Cauca- 
sian chain Avhich overhangs the Caspian Sea and forms the northern 
boundary of Albania, and m which he places the Amazons. Mela seems 
to a])ply the name to the whole chain which other writers call Caucasus, 
confining the latter term to a part of it. Plmy (B. r. c. 27 &amp; B. vi. c. 11)

In Lycia, after leaving its promontory \ we come to the 
town of Simena, Mount Chimfera^, which sends forth flames 
by night, and the city of Hephaestium^, the heights above 
which are also frequently on fire. Here too formerly stood the 
city of Olympus'* ; now we find the mountain places known 
as Gagae^, Corydalla^, and Khodiopolis''. Xear the sea is 
Limyra' with a river of like name, into which the Aryeandus 

gives precisely the same representation, with the additional error of 
making the Ceraunii (i. e. the Caucasus of others) part of the Great 
Taurus Chain. He seems to apply the name of Caucasus to the spurs 
which spread out both to the north-east and the south-east from the 
main chain near its eastern extremity, and which he regarded as a con- 
tinuous range, bordering the western shores of the Caspian. See B. vi. 
e. 10." — Dr. SynitKs Dictionary of Ancient Geography. 

^ Of CheHdonium, now Khelidonia, formed by the range of Taufus. 

2 See B. ii. c. 116. The flame wliich continually burned on this moun- 
tain has been examined by Beaufort, the modern traveller. The name of 
the moimtain is now Yanar : it is formed of a mass of scagUa with ser- 
pentine. Spratt says that the flame is notliing more than a stream of 
inflammable gas issuing from a crevice, such as is seen in several places 
in the Apennines. By Homer it is represented as a fabulous monster, 
wliich is explained by Servius, the commentator of Virgil, in the following 
manner. He says that flames issue from the top of tlie mountain, and 
that there are hons in the vicinity ; the middle part abounds ui goats, 
and the lower part ^^•ith seri^ents. Simena appears to be unknown. 

3 So called from "H^atoros, the Greek name of Vulcan. Pliny men- 
tions this spot also in B. ii. c. 110. The flame probably proceeded from 
an inflammable gas, or else was ignited by a stream of naphtha. 

^ More generally known as Pha?nicus, a flourisliing city on Mount 
Olympus ; now Yanar Dagh, a volcano on the eastern coast of Lycia, with 
wliich it often exchanged names. Having become the head-quarters of 
the pirates, it was destroyed by the Koman general Servilius Isauricus. 
Its ruins are to be seen at a spot called Deliktash. 

5 Mentioned again in B. xxxvi. c. SI, as tlie spot whence the qayafes 
lapis or ' agate ' took its name. The ruins at Aladja are regarded by 
Leake as marking the site of Gaga&gt; ; but Sir Charles Fellowes identifies 
the place with the modem village of Hascooe, the vicinity of wlvich is 
covered with ruins. 

^ On the road from Phasehs in Lycia to Patara. Its site is a village 
called Hadgivella, about sixteen miles south-west of Phaselis. The re- 
mains are very considerable. 

7 Tlie remains of Rhodiopolis were found by Spratt and Forbes in the 
vicinity of Corydalla.

north of which are supposed to be those of Limyra.

towns of Aperrse* and Antiphellos*, formerly called Ha- 
beasiis, and in a corner Phellos^ after which comes P}T:'ra, 
and then the city of Xanthus', fifteen miles from the sea, 
as also a river known by the same name. We then come 
to Patara*, formerly Pataros, and Sidyma, situate on a moun- 

^ The modern Akhtar Dagh. 

2 Now Andx-aki. Tliis was the port of Myi'a, next mentioned. It stood 
at the mouth of the river now known as the Andraki. Cramer observes 
that it was here St. Paul was put on board the ship of Alexandria, Acts 
xxvii. 5, 6. 

^ Still called Myra by the Greeks, but Dembre by the Turks, It was 
built on a rock twenty stadia from the sea. St. Pavd touched here on his 
voyage as a prisoner to Rome, and from the mention made of it in Acts 
xxvii. 5, 6, it would appear to have been an important sea-port. There 
are magnificent ruins of this city still to be seen, in part hewn out of the 
sohd rock. 

From an inscription found by Cockerell at the head of the Hassac 
Bay, it is thoiight that Aperlce is the proper name of tliis place, though 
again there are coins of Gordian which give the name as Aperrce. It is 
fixed by the Stadismus as sixty stadia west of Somena, which Leake sup- 
poses to be the same as tlie Simena mentioned above by Phny. 

* Now called Antephelo or Andifilo, on the south coast of Lycia, at 
the head of a bay. Its theatre is still complete, with the exception of 
the proscenium. There are also other interesting remains of antiquity. 

^ Fellowes places the site of PheUos near a village called Saaret, west- 
north-west of Antiphellos, where he fovmd the remains of a town ; but 
Spratt considers this to mark the site of the Pyrra of Phny, mentioned 
above — -judging from PHny's words. Modern geographers deem it more 
consistent with liis meamng to look for Pliellos north of Antiphellos than 
in any other du'ection, and the ruins at Tchookoorbye, north of Anti- 
phellos, on the spur of a mountain called FeUerdagh, are thought to be 
those of PheUos. 

' The most famous city of Lycia. It stood on the western bank of the 
river of that name, now called the Echen Chai. It was twice besieged, 
and on both occasions the inhabitants destroyed themselves with their 
property, first by the Persians under Harpagus, and afterwards by the 
Romans mider Brutus. Among its most famous temples were those of 
Sarpedon and of the Lycian Apollo. The ruins now kno^vn by the name 
of Gunikf have been explored by Sir C. Fellows and other travellers, 
and a portion of its remains are now to be seen in the British Museum, 
under the name of the Xanthian marbles. 

® Its ruins still bear the same name. It was a flourishing seaport, on 
a promontory of the same name, sixty stadia east of the mouth of the 
Xanthus. It was early colonized by the Dorians from Crete, and became 
a chief scat of the worsliip of Apollo, from whose son Patarus it was said 
to have received its name. Ptolemy Pliiladelphus enlarged it, and called

Lycia formerly contained seventy towns, now it has but 
thirty-six. Of these, the most celebrated, besides those 
already mentioned, are Canas^ Candyba, so celebrated for 
the Qi^nian Grove, Podalia, Choma, past which the river

it Arsinoe, but it still remained better known by its old name. This 
place was visited by St. Paul, who tlience took sliip for Phcenicia. See 
Acts xxi. 1. 

1 This was more properly the name of a mountain district of Lycia. 
Strabo speaks of Cragus, a mountain with eight summits, and a city of 
the same name. Beaufort thinks that Yedy-Eooroon, the Seven Capes, 
a group of high and rugged mountains, appear to have been the ancient 
]\Iount Cragus of Lycia. 

2 Probably the Gulf of Macri, equal in size to the Gulf of Satalia, 
which is next to it. 

3 This place lay in the interior at the base of Cragxis, and its ruins are 
still to be seen on the east side of the range, about Imlf-way between 
Telmessus and the termination of the range on the south coast. 

^ Its ruins are to be seen at Mei, or the modem port of Macri. 

5 Its site is unknown. That of Candyba lias been ascertained to be a 
place called Gendevar, east of the Xantlius, and a few miles from the coast. 
Its rock-tombs are said to be beautifully executed. The ffinian grove or 
forest, it has been suggested, may still be recognized in the extensive 
pine forest that now covers the mountain above the city. The sites of 
Podalia and Glioma seem to be unknown. 

^ In some editions "Cyane." Leake says that this place was discovered 
to the west of Anch'iaca by Cockcrell. It ap])ears from Scott and Ft)rbes's 
account of Lycia, that three sites have been found between port Tristorus 
and the inland valley of Kassabar, wliich from the inscriptions appeared 
anciently to have borne tliis name, Yarvoo, Gliiouristan, and Toussa. 
The former is the chief place and is covered witli ruins of the Roman and 
middle-age construction. At Gliiouristan lliere are Lycian rock-tombs. 

7 Its ruins are to be seen near the modern Doover, in the interior of 
Lycia, about two miles and a half east of the river Xanthus. Of the 
three places previously mentioned the sites apjjcar to be unknown. 

8 Mentioned by the geograjiher Stephanus as being in Caria. 

9 Its site is fixed at Katara, on both sides of the Katara Su, the most 
northern braneli of the Xanthus. Tlu; ruins are vory considerable, lying 
on both sides of the stream. Ualbura is a neuter phiral.

Agrippa has divided this region into two parts ; one of which 
he has bounded on the east by Phrygia and Lycaonia, on the 
west by the ^gean Sea, on the south by the Egyptian Sea, 
and on the north by Paphlagonia, making its length to be 
473 miles and its breadth 320. The other part he has

Upon the adjoining coast is Caria\ then Ionia, and beyond 
it ^olis. Caria surrounds Doris, which lies in the middle,

north-east by the mountains Messagis and Cadmus, dividing it from 
Lydia and Phrygia, and adjoining to Phrygia and Lycia on the south-east.

^ "Telmissus" is the reading here in some editions. 

^ Situate in the district of Caria called Persea. It was also the name 
given to a movmtainous district. In Hoskyn's map the ruins of Dsedala 
are placed near the head of the Gulf of Glaucus, on the west of a small 
river called Inegi Chai, probably the ancient Ninus, where Deedalus was 
bitten by a water-snake, in consequence of which he died.

Mela speaks only of a promontory of this name.

Glaucus, and east of Carinus. Its site is uncertain, but it may possibly 
be the place discovered by Fellows, which is proved by inscriptions to 
have been called Cadyanda, a name otherwise unknown to us. Tliis Hes

(28.) The river Indus \ which rises in the mountains of 
the Cibyrata?^, receives sixty-five rivers which are constantly 
flowing, besides upwards of 100 mountain torrents. Here 
is the free town of Caunos^, then the town of Pyrnos"*, the 
port of Cressa*, from which the isLand of Khodes is distant 
twenty miles ; the place where Loryma formerly stood, the 
towns of Tisanusa^, Paridion'^, and Lar&gt;Tnna^, the Gulf of

Ilyda, the Gulf of Schoenus, and the district of Bubasus^^ 
There was formerly the town of Acanthus here, another 

N.N.E. of Makri, on the Gulf of Glaucus or Makri, at a place called 
Hoozoomlee, situate on an elevated plain. 

' The same as the river Calbis of Strabo and Mela, at present the 
Dalamon Tehy, Quingi or Taas, having its sources in i\Iount Cadmus 
above Cibyra. It was said to have derived its name from an Indian, who 
had been thrown into it from an elephant. 

^ Their district was Cibyratis, of which the chief city was Cibyra. 
This place, uniting with the towns of Balbura, Bubon, and (Enianda, 
had the name of Tetrapohs ; of wliich league Cibyra was the head, mus- 
tering 30,000 infantry and 2000 cavalry. The u-on foimd in this district 
was easily cut with a chisel or other sliarp tool. The site of this power- 
ful city has been ascertained to be at Horzoom, on the Horzoom Tchy, 
a branch of the Dalamon Tchy or Indus. The ruins are very extensive, 
and the theatre in fine preservation. 

3 Placed by Strabo west of Calynda. The ancient descriptions of its 
locaHty vary, but the place now known as Kaiguez is said to denote its 
site. The Caunii are frequently mentioned in the Persian, Grecian, and 
Roman histories. It was noted for its dried figs, mentioned by Pliny in 
B. XV. c. 19. 

^ Supposed by Mannert to be the Physcus of Strabo and the Phnscffi 
of Ptolemy. 

5 Leake says that this harbour is now called Aplothika by the Greeks, 
and Porto Cavahcre by the Italians. He also says that on its western 
shore are the ruins of an Hellenic fortress and town, which are imdoubt- 
edly those of Loryma. 

fi It had a port of the same name.

now Capo Velo. The site of Hyda or Hyde is unknown.

name of which was Dulopolis. "We then come to Cnidos^ 
a free toAATi, situate on a promontory, Triopia^, and after 
that the towns of Pegusa and Stadia. 

At this last town Doris begins ; but, first, it may be as 
well to describe the districts that lie to the back of Caria 
and the several jurisdictions in the interior. The first of 
these^ is called Cibyratica , Cibyra being a town of Phrygia. 
Twenty-five states resort to it for legal purposes, together 
with the most famous city of Laodicea"*. 

(29.) This place at first bore the name of Diospolis, and 
after that of Ehoas, and is situate on the river Lycus, the 
Asopus and the Caprus^ washing its sides. The other people 
belonging to the same jurisdiction, whom it may be not 
amiss to mention, are the Hydrelitse^, the Themisones^, and 
the Hierapolitae^. The second jurisdiction receives its title 

^ Part of it was situate on an island now called Cape Krio, connected 
by a causeway with the mainland. Its site is covered with ruins of a 
most interesting character in every direction. The Triopian promontory, 
evidently alluded to by Pliny, is the modern Cape Krio. 

2 It has been remarked that in liis description here Phny is very brief 
and confused, and tliat he may intend to give the name of Triopia either 
to the small peninsida or island, or may include in this term the western 
part of the whole of the larger peninsula. 

^ Of these conventus. For an account of Cibyra see last page. 

■* On the Lycus, now known as the Choruk-Su. By different writers 
it has been assigned to Lydia, Caria, and Phrygia, but in the ultimate 
division of the Roman provinces it was assigned to the Greater Phrygia. 
It was founded by Antiochus II. on the site of a previous town, and 
named in honour of liis wife Laodice. Its site is occupied by ruins of 
great magnificence. In the Apostohc age it was the seat of a flourishing 
Clu-istian Chiirch, which however very soon gave signs of degeneracy, 
as we learn from St. John's Epistle to it. Revel, ii. 14-22. St. Paul also 
addresses it in common with the neighbouring church of Colossse. Its 
site is now called Eski-Hissar, or the Old Castle. 

^ A tributary of the Phrygian Mseander. 

^ The people of Hydrela, a town of Cai-ia, said to have been founded 
by one of three brothers who emigrated from Sparta.

* The people of Hierapolis, a town of Phrygia, situate on a height be- 
tween the rivers Lycus and Mseander, about five miles north of Laodicea, 
on the road from Apamea to Sardis. It was celebrated for its warm 
springs, and its Plutonium, or cave of Pluto, from which issued a me- 
phitic vapour of a poisonous nature ; see B. ii. c. 95. The Christian 
Chm^ch here is allvided to by St. Paul in liis Epistle to the Colossians, iv. 13.

those to be seen at Afioiu'-Kara-Hisar. From the time of Constantine 
tliis place became the capital of Phrygia Salutaris. It stood in a fi-uitful 
plain, near a raoimtain quarry of the celebrated Synnadic marble, which 
was white ^^•ith red veins and spots. This marble was also called " Doci- 
miticus," from Docimia, a nearer place. 

2 As already mentioned in C- 2-5 of the present Book. 

3 The site of Appia does not appear to be known. Cicero speaks of 
an apphcation made to him by the Appiani, when he was governor of 
Cilicia, respecting the taxes with which they were burdened, and the 
buildings of their town. 

^ Eucarpia was a town of Phrygia, not far from the sources of the 
Mreandcr, on the road from Doryla?um to Apamea Cibotus. The vine 
grew there in great luxuriance, and to its fruit fulness the town probably 
owed its name. Kiepert places it in the vicmity of Segielar, but its exact 
site is imknown. 

5 The site of Dorylseum is now called Eski-Shehr. The hot-baths here 
ai'e mentioned by Atlienjeus, and its waters were pleasant to the taste. 
8heep-feechng appears to have been carried on here to a gi'cat extent, and 
under the Greek empire it was a flourishing place. The site of Midseum 
does not seem to be known. 

" Tlie people of Juha, .Tuliopolis, or Julianopohs, a town of Lydia, 
probably to the south of Mount Tmolus. 

7 This place was built near Cclsenae by Antiochus Soter, and named 
after his mother Apama. Strabo says that it lay at the mouth of the 
river Marsyas. Its site has been fixed at the modem Denair. Some 
ancient ruins are to be seen. 

•' Pliny commits an error here ; Celoenoc was a diflercnt place from 
Apamea, though close to it. 

9 Meaning tlie " Fountains of the Pipe," and probably deriving its 
name from the legend here mentioned by Pliny, and in B. xvi. c. 4-t. 
Strabo describes the Marsyas and Ma^ander as rising, according to report, 
in one lak(^ above CeliTcnie* whicli produced reeds adapted for making the 
mouth-pieces of musical instruments, but he gives no name to tlie lake. 
Hamilton found near Denair or Apamea, a lake nearly two miles in cir- 
cumference, full of reeds and rushes, which he looks u]ion as the lake on 
the mountain Aulocrene, described by Pliny in the 31bt Chapter of the

Marsyas had tbe musical contest with Apollo as to supe- 
riority of skill in playing on the flute. Aulocrenae is the 
name given to a valley which lies ten miles on the road

diction, it may be as well to mention the Metropolitae\ the 
Dionysopolita)-, the Euphorbeni^, the Acmonenses^, the Pel- 
teni®, and the SiJbiani^ besides nine other nations of no note. 
Upon the Grulf of Doris^ we have Leucopolis, Hamaxitos, 
Eleus, and Euthene^. We then come to Pitaium, Eutane^, 
and Halicarnassus^", towns of Caria. To the jurisdiction of 
this last place six towns were appended by Alexander the 
Great, Theaugela^\ Sibde, Medmasa, Euralium, Pedasus, 
and Telmissus^^. Halicarnassus lies between two gulfs, 
those of Ceramus" and lasus^*. We then come to Myn-

diiferent occasions a region of Aulocrene, a valley of Aulocrene, and a 
mountain of Aulocrene. 

^ People of " the Mother City," said by Stephen of Byzantium to have 
received that name from Cybele, the Mother of the Gods.

letter of Cicero's to his brother Quintus, in which he speaks of the people 
of this place as being very hostile to the latter. 

3 The site of Euphorbium is denoted, according to Leake, by the mo- 
dern Sandukh. It lay between Synnas and Apamea, and not impro- 
bably, like Eucarpia, received its name from the fertihty of its territory. 

■* The site of Acmona has been fixed at Ahatkoi, but it seems doubtful. 
^ The site of Pelta is by D'Anville called Eis-Chak or Hou-Chak. 
^ The people of Silbium or Silbia, near Metropolis. 

7 The Dorian settlements on the coast of Caria were so called. The 
Dorian G\ilf was probably the Sinus Ceramicus mentioned below. 

8 Of these places nothing whatever seems to be known. 
^ Pitaium and Eutane seem to be unknown. 

^^ A member of the Dorian HexapoUs, or League of the Six Cities. 
Tlie site of this famous city is occupied by the modern Boodroima, and 
its ruins are very extensive. It was famous as being the birth-place of 
the two historians Herodotus and Dionysius. It was the largest and 
best fortified city of Caria. " According to Parisot the site of tliis 

place is now called Angeh and Karabaglas. 

^2 This place must not be confounded with Telmessus or Telmissus in 
Lycia, which has been previously mentioned. It was situate six miles 
from Hahcarnassus. Of the other places here mentioned nothing seems 
to be known.

Neapolis-, Carj'anda^, the free town of Termera"*, Bargyla", 
and the town of Tasus®, from which the lasian Gulf takes 
its name. 

Caria is especially distinguished for the fame of its places 
in the interior ; for here are Mylasa^, a free town, and that 
of Antiochia**, on the site of the former towns of Sym- 
majthos and Cranaos : it is now surrounded by the rivers 
Maeander^ and Orsinus^". In this district also was formerly 
Maeaudi'opolis" ; we find also Eumenia^"-, situate on the river 
CludroSjthe river Glaucus'', the town of Lysias andOrthosa", 

^ Its niins are to be seen at the port called Giamishlu. This was a 
Dorian colony on the coast of Caria, founded probably on the site of the 
old town of the Leleges. 

2 It has been suggested that this was only another name for the new 
to^^^l of Myndos, in contradistinction to Pala?omyndos, or "old MyndoS." 

3 Scylax the geographer is supposed to have been a native of tliis 
place. The town is supposed to have been built partly on the mainland 
and partly on an island. Pastra Lunani is supposed to have been the 
harbour of Caryanda. 

^ A Dorian city on the Promontory of Termerium. 

5 Situate near lasus and Myndos. Leake conjectures that it may have 
been on the bay between Pastra Limane and Asyn Kalosi. There was a 
statue here of Artemis Cindyas, under the bare sky, of wliich the incre- 
dible story was told that neither rain nor snow ever feU on it. 

^ See note ^* on the last page. 

7 Its ruins are to be seen at the spot stUl called Melacso. It was a 
very floiu'ishing city, eight mUes from the coast of the Gulf of lasus, and 
situate at the foot of a^rock of fine white marble. It was partly destroyed 
in the Roman civd wars by Labienus. Its ruins are very extensive. 

'** Hamilton has fixed tlie site of tliis place between four and five miles 
south-east of Kuyuja, near the mouth of the valley of the Kara-Su. The 
sm-rounchng district was famous for the excellence of its figs. The city 
was built by Antiochus, the son of Seleucus.

tlie district of Berecyntlius\ Nysa^, and Tralles^, also called 
Euanthia^, Seleucia, and Antiochia: it is washed by the 
river Eudon, wliile the Thebais runs through it. Some 
authors say that a nation of Pygmies formerly dwelt here. 
Besides the preceding towns, there are Thydonos, Pyrrha^, 
Eurome®, Heraclea', Amyzon^, the free town of Alabanda^, 
which has given name to that jurisdiction, the free town of 
Stratonicea^**, Hynidos, Ceramus^^ Trcezene^^, and Phorontis. 

' The situation of this district is not known. See B. xvi. c. 16, where 
it appears that this region was famous for its boxwood. 

2 One of the numerous places of that name devoted to the worship of 
Bacchus. It was built on both sides of the ravine of the brook Eudon, 
which fell into the Mteander. Its ruins are to be seen at Sultan-Hissar, 
a httle to the west of HazeH. 

3 Its ruins are to be seen at Grhiuzel-Hissar, near Aidin. This was a 
flourishing commercial city, included sometimes in Ionia, sometimes in 
Caria. It stood on the banks of the Eudon, a tributary of the river 
Mseander. Under the Seleucidse it was called Antiochia and Seleucia. 

4 From the beauty and fertility of the surrounding country. 

5 An Ionic town of Caria, on the north side of the Sinus Latmicus, 
fifty stadia from the mouth of the Mseander. 

6 Or Euromus, a town of Caria, at the foot of Mount Grion, which 
runs parallel with Latmos. Ruins of a temple to the north-west of Ala- 
banda are considered to belong to Euromus. 

7 A town of uncertain site. It must not be confounded with the place 
of the same name, mentioned in c. 31 of the present Book. 

8 The ruins of its citadel and walls still exist on the east side of 
Mount Latmos, on the road from Bafi to Tchisme. 

9 Situate about twenty miles south of Tralles, The modern site is 
doubtful, but Arab Hissa, on a branch of the Mteander, now called the 
Tchma. is supposed to represent Alabanda. It was notorious for the 
luxuriousness of its inhabitants. A stone found in the vicinity was used 
for making glass and glazing vessels. See B. xxxvi. c. 13. 

^" Built by Antiochus I. Soter, and named, in honovir of his wife, Stra- 
tonice. It stood south of Alabanda, near the river Marsyas. It is sup- 
posed that it stood on the site of a former city called Idrias, and still 
earlier, Chrysaoris. 

^^ D'AnvHle identifies it with a place called Keramo, but no such 
place appears to be known. Strabo places it near the sea between Cnidus 
and Halicarnass'iis, and Ceramus comes next after Cnidus. Ptolemy 
seems to place it on the south side of the bay. Of Hynidos nothing 
appears to be known. 

^2 Its situation is unknown ; but there can be httle doubt that it was 
founded by the Dorians who emigrated to the coast of Asia Minor from 
Argolis and Trcezene m the Peloponnesus. Phorontis appears to be 
unknown.

CHAP. 31. — IONIA. 

Ionia begins at the Grulf of lasos, and has a long winding 
coast with numerous bays. First comes the Grulf of Basili- 
cum^, then the Promontory^ and town of Posideum, and the 
oracle once called the oracle of the Branchidse^", but now of 
Didymsean Apollo, a distance of twenty stadia from the sea- 
shore. One hundred and eighty stadia thence is Miletus ^^, 

1 Now called the Sarabat. It was famous for its gold-producing sands. 

2 On the road between Thyatira and Sardes : near it was situate the 
necropohs of Sardes. 

3 Strabo says that some persons called the citadel only by that name. 
^ There was a city of Mysia or Phrygia of the name of Cadus or Cadi ; 

but nothing is known of the place here aUuded to, whose people would 
appear to have been a colony from Macedonia. 

^ The people of Philadelphia, now Ala- Cher, or the "Fine City," 
twelve leagues south-east of Sardes, and nine leagues south of Attaha. 

^ So called from the Greek 'AttoXXwj'os Upov, " the temple of Apollo," 
in the vicinity of wliicli, south-east of Pergamus, their town was probably 
situate. Nothing is known of these localities. 

' Dwellers in Mesotmolus, a town wliich, from its name, would ap* 
pear to have been situate on the middle of Mount Tmolus. 

^ Now called the Gulf of Melasso. ^ Now the Cape of Melasso. 

^•^ The remains of the Temple of Didymsean Apollo at Branchidse are 
BtUl visible to those sailing along the coast. It was in the Milesian ter- 
ritory, and above the harbour Panormus. The name of the site was 
probably Didyma or Didymi, but the place was also called Branchidse, I 
from that being the name of a body of priests who had the care of the 
temple. We learn from Herodotus that Croesus, king of Lydia, consulted 
this oracle, and made rich presents to the temple. The temple, of which 
only two columns are left, was of wliite marble.

the capital of Ionia, which formerly had the names of Lele- 
geis, Pityusa, and Anactoria, the mother of more tlian ninety 
cities, founded upon all seas ; nor must she be deprived of the 
honour of having Cadmus^ for her citizen, who was the first 
to write in prose. The river Meander, rising from a lake in 
Moiuit Aiiloerene, waters many cities and receives numerous 
tributary streams. It is so serpentine in its course, that it 
is often thought to turn back to the very spot from which 
it came. It lii'st runs through the district of Apamea, then 
that of Eumeuia, and then the plains of Bargyla ; after 
which, with a placid stream it passes through Caria, water- 
ing all that territory with a slime of a most fertilizing quality, 
and then at a distance of ten stadia from Miletus with a 
gentle current enters the sea. AYe then come to Mount 
Latmus^, the towns of Heraclea^, also called by the same 
name as the mountain, Carice, Myus"*, said to have been first 
built by lonians who came from Athens, Naulochum^ and 
Priene^. Upon that part of the coast which bears the naine 
of Trogilia^ is the river G-essus. This district is lield sacred 
by all the lonians, and thence receives the name of Panionia. 
Near to it was formerly the town of Phygela, built by 



of the great changes made on the coast by the river Maeandcr. They are 
usuaUy supposed to be those at the poor vilkge of Palatia on the south 
bank of the Mendereh ; but Foi'bigcr has sliown that these are more 
probably the remains of Myus, and that tliose of ]\Iiletus are buried in a 
lake forined by the Mendereh at the foot of Mount Latmus. 

^ See B. vii. c. 57. Josephus says that he hved very shortly before 
the Persian invasion of Cxreece. 

2 Now called the Monte di Palatia. 

3 Generally called "Heraclea upon Latmus," from its situation at the 
western foot of Mount Latmus. Ruins of tliis town still exist at the 
foot of that mountain on the borders of Lake BallL 

^ Its ruins are now to be seen at Palatia. It was the smallest city of 
the Ionian Confederacy, and was situate at the mouth of the Maiauder, 
tliirty stadia from its mouth. 

5 Mannert says that its ruins are to be seen at a spot called by the 
Turks Sarasun-Kalesi. 

6 One of the twelve Ionian cities, situate at the foot of Mount Mycale. 
It stood originally on the shore, but the change in the coast by the allu- 
vial deposits of the Majander left it some distance from the land. It was 
celebrated as being the birth-place of the philosopher Bias. Its nuns 
^re to be seen at the spot called Sauisun.

Above these places is Magnesia""^, distinguished by the sur- 
name of the "Maeandrian," and sprung fromMagnesia inThes- 
saly : it is distant from Ephesus fifteen miles, and three more 
from Tralles. It formerly had the names of Thessaloche and 
Androlitia, and, lying on the sea-shore, it has withdrawn from 
the sea the islands known as the Derasidse* and joined them 
to the mainland. In the interior also is Thyatira^, washed 
by the Lycus ; for some time it was also called Pelopia and 
Euhippia^. 

Upon the coast again is Mantium, and Ephesus^, which 
was founded by the Amazons^, and formerly called by so 
many names : Alopes at the time of the Trojan war, after that 
Ortygia and Morges, and then Smyrna, with the surname of 
Trachia, as also Samornion and Ptelea. This city is built 
on Mount Pion, and is washed by the Cayster', a river which 
rises in the Cilbian range and brings down the waters of 
many streams^", as also of Lake Pegasseus^^, which receives

- Between Ephesus and Neapolis. It belonged to the Samians who 
exchanged with the Ephesians for Neapohs, which lay nearer to their 
island. The modem Scala Nova occupies the site of one of them, it is 
uncertain which. 

3 Its ruins are to be seen at the modern Inek-Bazar. It was situate 
on the river Lethseus, a tributary of the Mseander. It was famous for its 
temple of Artemis Leucophryene, the riiins of which stiU exist. 

4 SeeB.ii. c. 91. 

* Now known as Ak-Hissar or the " White Castle." Strabo informs 
us that it was founded by Seleucus Nicator, 

^ From the excellence of its horses. 

7 Its ruins are to be seen near the modern Ayazaluk. It was the chief 
of the twelve Ionian cities on the coast of Asia Minor, and devoted to 
the worsliip of Artemis, whose temple here was deemed one of the won- 
ders of the world. Nothing, except some traces of its fomidations, is 
now to be seen of this stupendous building. 

^ It was more generally said to have been founded by the Carians and 
the Leleges. 

^ Now called the Kara-Su, or Black Eiver, or Kuchuk-Meinder, or 
Little Mseander. 

^° It has been observed that though Pliny seems to say that the Cayster 
receives many streams, they must have had but a short course, and could 
only be so many channels by which the rivers descend from the mountain | 
elopes that shut in the contracted basin of the river. '

those discharged by the river Phyrites'. Prom these streams 
there accumulates a large quantity of slime, which vastly 
increases the soil, and has added to the mainland the island 
of Syrie^, M'hich now lies in the midst of its plains. In this 
city is the fountain of Calippia^ and the temple of Diana, 
which last is surrounded by two streams, each knoA\Ti by the 
name of Selenus, and flowing from opposite directions. 

After leaving Ephesus there is another Mantium, belong- 
ing to the Colophonians, and in the interior Colophon"* itself, 
past which the river Halesus^ flows. After tliis we come to 
the temple® of the Clarian Apollo, and Lebedos'^ : the city 
of Notium'' once stood here. Next comes the Promontory 
of Coryceium'-', and then Mount Mimas, which projects 150 
miles into the sea, and as it approaches the mainland sinks 
down into extensive plains. It was at this place that Alex- 
ander the Grreat gave orders for the plain to be cut through, a 
distance of seven miles and a half, for the purpose of joining 
the two gulfs and making an island of Erythra?'" and Mimas. 

Smyrna to Ephesus, into which the Phyrites flows, and out of which it 
conies a considerable stream. 

^ The Phjrites is a email river that is crossed on the road from Ephesus 
to Smyrna, and joins the Cayster on the right bank ten or twelve miles 
above Ayazaluk, near the site of Ephesus. 

2 See B. ii. c. 91. for further mention of this island. 

3 Said to be derived from the Greek, meaning " The beautiful (stream) 
from Pion." 

^ One of the twelve Ionian cities of Asia, founded by Andrsemon. 
Notium was its port. There do not seem to be any remains of either of 
these places. 

5 Called also the Hales or Ales, and noted for the coolness of its 
waters. 

* At Clarus, near Colophon. "\Mien Germnnicus was on his way to 
the East, this oracle foretold to him his speedy death. Chandler is of 
opinion that lie discovered the site of this place at Zille, where he found 
a spring of water with marble steps to it, which he considers to have 
been the sacred fountain. Others again suggest that these ruins may be 
those of Notium. 

7 Its site was probably near the modem Ekklesia, but no traces of the 
city itself arc to be found. 

8 Implying that in his time Notrum was not in existence, wliereas in 
reality Notium superseded Old Colophon, of wliich it was the port, and 
Was sometimes known as New Colophon. 

9 Now known as Cape Curco. 

10 The site of this place is now known as Ritri, on the south side of a 



470 plint's kattteal histoet. [Book v. 

Near Erytlirse formerly stood the towns of Pteleon, Helos, 
and Dorion; we now find the river Aleon, Corynaeum, a 
Promontory of Mount Mimas, Clazomenae^ Partheuie^, and 
Hippi^, knowTi by the name of Chytrophoria, when it 
formed a group of islands ; these were united to the con- 
tinent by the same Alexander, by means of a causeway^ two 
stadia in length. In the interior, the cities of Daphnus, 
Hermesia, and Sipylum^, formerly called Tantalis, and the 
capital of Mseonia, where Lake Sale now stands, are now 
no longer in existence : ArchaeopoKs too, which succeeded 
Sipylum, has perished, and in their turns Colpe and Libade, 
which succeeded it. 

On returning thence^ towards the coast, at a distance of 
twelve miles we find Smyrna"^, originally founded by an 
Amazon [of that name], and rebuilt by Alexander ; it is re- 
ireshed by the river Meles, which rises not far off. Through 
this district run what may almost be called the most famous 
mountains of Asia, Mastusia in the rear of Smyrna, and 
Termetis^, joining the foot of Olympus. Termetis is joined 

small peninsula, which projects into the bay of Ery thrse. The ruins are 
considerable. 

^ On the south side of the bay of Smyrna. In Strabo's time this city 
appears to have been removed from Chytrium, its original site. Chandler 
ibund traces of the city near Vourla, from wliich he came to the conclu- 
sion that the place vpas very small and iuconsiderable. 

2 According to Nicander, tliis was a mountain of the territory of Cla- 
zomenae, almost surrounded by sea. 

3 Or " the Horses," originally four islands close to the mainland, off 
Clazomense. 

^ This was probably the same causeway that was observed by Chandler 
in the neighbom'hood of Vourla, the site of ancient Clazomense. 

^ See B. ii. c. 91, where he speaks of this place as being swallowed up 
in the earth. 

6 From Clazomense. 

^ Now called Izmir by the Turks, Smyrna by the western nations of 
Europe ; the only one of the great cities on the western coast of Asia 
Minor that has siirvived to the present day. This place stood at the 
head of the cities that claimed to be the birth-place of Homer ; and the 
poet was worshipped here for a hero or demi-god in a magnificent build- 
ing called the Homereum. There are but few remaius of the ancient 
city : the modern one is the greatest commercial city of the Levant.

forms a tract of plains, and gives them its own name. It 
rises near Dorylaeum'', a city of Phrygia, and in its course 
receives several rivers, among them the one called tlie Phryx, 
which divides Caria from the nation to which it gives 
name ; also the Hyllus^ and the Cryos, themselves swollen

' The people of Hypaepae, a small town of Lydia, on the southern 
slope of Mount Tmolus, forty-two miles from Ephesus. Under the 
Persian supremacy, the worship of Fire was introduced at this place. 
Arachne, the spinner, and competitor with Minerva, is represented by 
Ovid as dwelling at this place; he calls it on two occasions "the little 
Hypsepse." Leake is of opinion that the ruins seen at Bereki belong to 
this place. 

** The people of Dios Hieron, or the " Temple of Jupiter." This was 
a small place in Ionia between Lebedus and Colophon. It has been sug- 
gested that it was on the banks of the Cayster, but its site is uncertain. 

^ ^olis, properly so called, extended as far north as the promontory 
of Lectum, at the northern entrance of the bay of Adramyttium. 

^* Near Cyme, a place of Pelasgian origin. It was called Egyptian 
Larissa, because Cyrus the Great settled here a body of his Egyptian 
soldiers. According to D'AnviUe its site is stiU known as Larusar. 

1* Said to have been so called from Cyme an Amazon. It was on the 
northern , side of the Hermus : Herodotus gives it the surname of Phri- 
conis. Its site is supposed to be at the modern SanderH or Sandarho. 
The father of the poet Hesiod was a native of tliis place. 

'2 It was probably so called in honour of the Emperor Augustus. 

^"* Situate at a short distance from the coast. We learn from Tacitus 
that it suffered from the great earthquake in the time of Tiberius. Its 
site is called Guzel-Hissar, according to D'Anville.

Adala, on the river Hermus, but Hamilton found no remains of anti- 
quity there.

also stood here on an island reclaimed from the sea and joined 
to the land : now only its harbours are left"*. AVe then come 
to the town of Elaea^ the river Caicus^, which flows from

* Or the " Xew Walls." Strabo speaks of it as distant thirty stadia 
from Larissa. 

2 Its site is unkno\^Ti ; but it must not be confounded with the place 
of that name mentioned in the last Chapter, which stood on the sea-coast. 
It suffered from the great earthquake in the reign of Tiberius Caesar. 

3 Or Grynium, foi'ty stadia from Myrina, and seventy from Ela^a. It 
contained a sanctuary of Apollo with an ancient oracle and a splendid 
temple of white marble. Parmenio, the general of Alexander, took the 
place by assault and sold the inhabitants as slaves. It is agaiu mentioned 
by Pliny in B. xxxii. c. 21. 

* Tliis passage seems to be in a corrupt state, and it is difficult to 
arrive at Phny's exact meaning. 

5 The port of the Pergameni. Strabo places it south of the river 
Caicus, twelve stadia from that river, and 120 from Pergamum. Its site 
is imcertam, but Leake fixes it at a place called KhseU, on the road from 
the south to Pergamum. 

^ Its modern name is said to be Ak-Su or Bakir. 

7 On the coast of the Elaitic gulf. It was almost destroyed by an 
earthquake in the reign of the Emperor Titus. Its site is by some thought 
to have been at SanderU. 

8 Supposed to have been situate near the modem Cape Coloni. It 
•was here that in the war with Antiochus, B.C. 191-190, the Roman 
fleet was hauled up for the winter and protected by a ditch or rampart. 

9 So called from Lysimachus, the son of Agathocles. 

^° A strong place opposite to Lesbos. It was on the road from Adra- 
myttium to the plain of the Caicus. Its site is generally fixed at Dikeli 
Koi. 

" Or Carine. The army of Xerxes, on its route to the Hellespont, 
marched tlirough this place. Its site is unknown. 

^2 It lay outside of the bay of Adramyttium and the promontory of 
Pyrrha. 

J3 Mentioned in the Iliad with Chryse and Tenedos.

then come to the city of Perperene^, which still survives, 
the district of Heracleotes, the town of Coryphas®, the 
rivers Grrylios and Ollius, the region of Aphrodisias'', 
which formerly had the name of Politice Orgas, the di- 
strict of Scepsis^, and the river Evenus^, on whose banks 
the towns of Lyruesos^" and Miletos have fallen to decay. 
In this district also is Mount Ida^\ and on the coast Adra- 
mytteos'^, formerly called Pedasus, which gives its name to 
the gulf and the jurisdiction so called. The other rivers are 
the Astron, Cormalos, Crianos, Alabastros, and Hieros, flow- 
ing from Mount Ida : in the interior is Mount Grargara^^, 

1 Not improbably the Cbryse, mentioned by Homer in the IHad, B. i. 
11. 37, 390, 431 ; but there were several places of tliis name. 

2 See the note to Scepsis in the present Chapter. 

3 Or Grergis, Gergithus, or Gergithes, a town in the Troad, north of 
Scamander. It was a place with an acropoUs and strong walls. Attains, 
king of Pergamus, transplanted the people of Gergis to another spot 
near the som'ces of the Caicus, whence we afterwards find a place called 
Gergetha or Gergithion, ia the vicinity of Larissa. The old town of 
Gergis was by some said to have been the birth-place of the Sibyl, and 
its coins have her image impressed on them. 

* Also called Neandria, upon the Hellespont. 

^ South of Adramyttium ; in its vicinity were copper-mines and cele- 
brated vineyards. It was here that Thucydides is said to have died. 

^ In the district of Coryphantes, opposite to Lesbos, and north of 
Atarneus. Pliny speaks of the oysters of Coryphas, B. xxxii. c. 6. 

7 This Aphrodisias does not appear to have been identified. 

^ Again mentioned by PUny in B. xi. c. 80. Scepsis was an ancient 
city in the interior of the Troad, south-east of Alexandria, ui the moun- 
tains of Ida. Its inhabitants were removed by Antigonus to Alexandria ; 
but being permitted by Lysimaehus to retmni to then* homes, they built 
a new city, and the remains of the old town were then called Palsescepsis. 
This place is famous in hterary history for being the spot where certain 
MSS. of Aristotle and Theophrastus were buried to prevent their transfer 
to Pergamus. When dug up they were found nearly destroyed by mould, 
and in this condition were removed by Sylla to Athens. 

^ Sometimes called the Lycormas, now known as the Fidhari or Fidharo. 

10 Frequently mentioned by Homer. 

^^ Still known as Ida or Kas-Dagh. 

^2 More generally known as Adramyttium or Adramyteum, now Adra- 
miti or Edremit. According to tradition it was founded by Adramys, 
the brother of Croesus, king of Lydia. It is mentioned as a sea-port in 
the Acts, xxvii. 2. There are no traces of ancient remains on its site.

with a town of the same name. Again, on the coast we 
meet with Antanclros\ formerly called Edonis, and after 
that Cimmeris and Assos, also called Apollonia. The town 
of Palamedium also formerly stood here. The PromontorT 
of Lecton"" separates -3!^olis from Troas. In ^'Eolis there 
was formerly the city of Polymedia, as also Chrysa, and a 
second Larissa. The temple of Smintheus^ is still standing ; 
Colone'* in the interior has perished. To Adramyttium 
resort upon matters of legal business the Apolloniatae*, 
whose town is on the river Rhyndacus^, the Erizii'', the 
Miletopolitse^, the Poemaneni^, the Macedonian Asculacte, 
the Polichnaei^", the Pionitae^\ the Cilician Mandacadeni,

Hellespontii^^, and others of less note. 

fatnous for its fertility. The modem village of Ine is supposed to occupy 
the site of the ancient town of Gargara. 

1 Now Antandro, at the head of the Gulf of Adramyttium. Aristotle 
also says that its former name was Edonis, and that it was inhabited by 
a Thracian tribe of Edoni. Herodotus as well as Aristotle also speak of 
the seizure of tlie place by the Cinimerii in their incursion into Asia. 

2 Now Cape Baba or Santa Maria, the south-west promontory of the 
Troad. 

3 Or Sminthian Apollo. This appears to have been situate at the 
Chrysa last mentioned by Phny as no longer in existence. Strabo places 
Chrvsa on a hill, and he mentions the temple of Smintheus and sj)eak3 
of a symbol wliich recorded the etymon of that name, the mouse which 
lay at the foot of the wooden figiire, the work of 8coi)as. Accoriling to 
an ancient tradition, Apollo had lus name of Smintheus givi-n him as 
being the mouse-destroyer, for, accorduig to Apion, the meaning of Smin- 
theus was a " mouse," 

^ AccorcUng to tradition this place was in early times the residence of 
Cycnus, a Tlu-acian prince, -who possessed the adjoining country, and the 
island of Tenedos, opposite to which Colone was bituatc on the mainland. 
Pliny however here places it in the interior. 

5 The site of this Apollonia is at Abulliontc, on a lake of the same 
name, the Apolloniatis of Strabo. Its remains are very inconsiderable. 

^ Or Lvcus, now known as the Edrenos.

CHAP. 33. — TROAS AND THI^ ADJOINING NATIONS. 

The first place in Troas is Hamaxitus^ then Cebrenia^, 
and then Troas^ itself, formerly called Antigonia, and now 
Alexandria, a Eoman colony. We then come to the town 
of Nee**, the Scamander^, a navigable river, and the spot 
where in former times the town of Sigeum^ stood, upon a 
promontory. We next come to the Port of the Achaeans'', into 
which the Xanthus^ flows after its union with the Simois^, 
, and forms the Palaescamander^°, which was formerly a lake. 
The other rivers, rendered famous by Homer, namely, the 
E-hesus, the Heptaporus, the Caresus, and the Rhodius, have 
left no vestiges of their existence. The Granicus^\ taking a 
difterent route, flows into the Propontis^'. The small city of 
Scamandria, however, still exists, and, at a distance of a mile 

at the foot of Mount Olympus ; next to whom, on the south and west, 
were the Abretteni. 

^ On the south-western coast of the Troad, fifty stadia south of La- 
rissa. In the time of Strabo it had ceased to exist. No ruins of this 
place have been known to be discovered, but Prokesch is induced to think 
that the architectm'al remains to be seen near Cape Baba are those of 
Hamaxitus. 

2 Or Cebrene or Cebren. It was separated from the territory of Scepsis 
by the river Menander. Leake supposes it to have occupied the higher 
region of Ida on the west, and that its site may have been at a place 
called Kushunlu Tepe, not far from Baramitsh. 

3 Mentioned in Acts xvi. 8. It is now called Eski Stambul or Old 
Stambid. It was situate on the coast of Troas, opposite to the south- 
eastern point of the island of Tenedos, and north of Assus. It was 
founded by Antigonus, under the name of Antigonia Troas, and peopled 
with settlers from Scepsis and other neighbouring towns. The ruins of 
tliis city are very extensive, * Or Nea, mentioned in B. ii. c. 97. 

^ Now called the Mendereh-Chai. 

^ On the north-west promontory of Troas. Here Homer places the 
Grecian fleet and camp during the Trojan war. The promontory is now 
called Yenisheri. 

' Now called Jeni-Scher, according to Ansart. It was at this spot 
that the Greeks landed in their expedition against Troy. 

8 Usually identified with the Mendereh-Chai or Scamander.

and a half from its harbour, IHum\ a place exempt from 
tribute'-, the fountain-head of universal fame. Beyond the 
gulf are the shores of Ehoeteum^, peopled by the towns of 
Ehoeteum'*, Dardanium% and Al'isbe^ There was also in 
former times a town of Achilleon^, founded near the tomb of 
Achilles by the people of Mitylene, and afterwards rebuilt 
by the Athenians, close to the spot where his fleet had been 
stationed near Sigeura. There was also the town of ^an- 
tion^, founded by the Ehodians upon the opposite point, 
near the tomb of Ajax, at a distance of thirty stadia from 
Sigeum, near the spot where his fleet was stationed. Above 
Jj^olis and part of Troas, in the interior, is the place called 
Teuthrania^, inhabited in ancient times by the ^Mvsians. 
Here rises the river Caicus already mentioned. Teuthrania 
was a powerful nation in itself, even when tlie whole of ^^olis 
was held by the Mysians. In it are the Pioniae^", Andera'', 

* It is not exactly known whether New Hium was built on the same 
site as the Ilium or Troy which had been destroyed by the Greeks ; but 
it has been considered improbable tliat the exploits mentioned in tho 
Iliad sliould have happened in so sljort a space as (hat lying between tho 
later IHum and the coast. The site of New Ilium is generally considered 
to be tho spot covered with ruins, now called Kissarlik, between tho 
villages called Kum-kioi, KaUi-fath, and Tcliiblak. 

2 The Dictator SyUa showed especial favour to Ilium. 

3 Now called Cape Intepeh or Barbieri. 

* The modern Paleo Castro probably occupies its site. 

5 More generally called Dardanus, or Dardanum, said to have been 
built by Dardanus. It was situate about a mile south of the ]-)roinon- 
tory Dardanis or Dardanium. Its exact site does not apjiear to bo 
known : from it the modern Dardanelles are supposed to have derived 
their name. 

6 Situate between Percote and Abydus, and founded by Scamandrius 
and Ascanius the son of yEneas. The village of Moussa is supposi&gt;d to 
OCCUJ1V its site. The army of Alexander nuistered here after crossing 
the Hellespont. 

7 Alexander the Great visited this ]ilace on his Asiatic expedition in 
B.C. 334, and placed chaplets on the tomb of Achilles. 

" So called from Ma», the Greek name of Ajax. 

5 Teutlirania was in the south-western corner of Mysia, between Tem- 
nus and the borders of Lydia, where in very early times Teuthras was 
said to have founded a Mysian kingdom, which was early subdued by 
the kings of Lydia : this ])art was also called rergamene.

Pergamus, and situate in the Teuthranian district of Mysia on the 
northern bank of the river Caicus. Under its kmgs, its hbrarV almost 
equalled that of Alexandi-ia, and the formation of it gave rise to the in-

CHAP. 34. (31.) — THE ISLANDS WHICH LIE IN FEONT OF ASIA. 

^ Of the islands which lie before Asia the first is the one 
situate in the Canopic Moutli of the Nile, and which received 
its name, it is said, from Canopus, the pilot of Menelaiis. A 
second, called Pharos, is joined by a bridge to Alexandria, 
and was made a colony by the Dictator Caesar. In former 
times it was one day's *saiP from the mainland of Bg}-pt ; at 
the present day it directs ships in their course by means of 
the fii-es which are lighted at night on the tower^ there ; for 
in consequence of the insidious nature of the shoals, there 
are only three channels by wliich Alexandria can be ap- 
proached, those of Steganus*', Posideum'' and Taurus. 

In the Phoenician Sea, before Joppe there is the island of 
Paria^, the whole of it forming a town. Here, they say, 
Andromeda was exposed to the monster : the island also of 
Arados, already mentioned^, between which and the con- 
tinent, as we learn from Mucianus, at a depth of fifty cubits 
in the sea, fresh water is brought up from a spriug at the 
very bottom by means of leather pipes *°. 

^ By some supposed to have been a ]&gt;eople of Phrygia.

CHAP. 35.— CYPRUS. 

The Pamphylian Sea contains some islands of little note. 
The Cilician, besides four others of very considerable size, has 
Cyprus \ which lies opposite to the shores of Cilicia and Sy- 
ria, running east and west ; in former times it was the seat 
of nine kingdoms. Timosthenes states that the circumfer- 
ence of this island is 427 miles, Isidorus^ 375 ; its length, 
between the two Promontories of Dinse^ and Acamas"* lying 
on the west, is, according to Artemidorus, 1601 miles, ac- 
cording to Timosthenes, 200. Philonides says that it was 
formerly called Acamantis, Xenagoras that it had the 
names of Cerastis^, Aspelia, Amathusia, and Macaria^, 
while Astynomus gives it the names of Cryptos'^ and Co- 
linia. Its towns are fifteen in number, Neapaphos', 
Palsepaphos^, Curias^", Citium^\ Corineum, Salamis'^, Ama- 

from the spring .A in Ibrahjm, in tlie sea, a few rods from the shore of 
the opposite coast. ^ Now called Kibris. 

2 Strabo makes it 425. Hardouin remarks that Isidorus has not made 
allowance for the margin of the creeks and bays. 

3 The north-eastern extremity of Cyprus. It is now called Capo Sant 
Andreas. It is more generally known in the editions of PHny by the 
name of Dinaretum. 

^ Now called Capo Sant Epifanio, or Pifano, after the celebrated me- 
tropolitan of Cy]^)rus. It is the western extremity of the island. 

^ From the Greek Kepas, "a horn." It was not improbably so called 
from the numerous horns or promontories on its coast. 

^ From the G-reek fiaicapios, *' blessed," in compliment to its fertile 
soil and deUghtful temperature. 

7 Apparently from the Greek Kpvirrbi, "concealed." Stephanus By- 
zantinus says that it was so called because it was frequently hidden 
beneath the surface of the sea. 

* Or New Paphos. The spot is still called Bafa or Bafo. 

^ Or Old Paphos, now Kukala or Konukha. Old Paphos was situate 
ne-4ir the promontory Zephyrium on the river Bocarno, where it had a 
good harbour ; while New Paphos lay more inland, in the midst of a 
fertile plain, sixty stadia from the former. Old Paphos was the cliief 
seat of worship of Aplirodite or Venus, who was said to have landed at 
that place after her ascent from the sea. 

^^ Situate on the most southerly point in the island ; now Capo Gavatta 
or delle Gatte. 

^^ A town situate on the south coast of Cyprus. Its ruins are to be 
seen between Larnika and the port now known as Sahnes ; they are veiy

K nodes and the mainland, and which seems to be the island marked 
Alessa m the maps. There was another of the same name close to the 
snore ot Cihcia, afterwards knowm by the name of Scbaste.

islands known as the Clides\ lying before the promontory 
which faces Syria ; and again at tlie end of the other cape 
is Stiria: over against Neapaphos is Hierocepia^ and op- 
posite to Salamis are the Salaminise. 

In the Lycian Sea are the islands of lUyris, Telendos, 
and Attelebussa^ the three barren isles called Cypri^, and 
Dionysia, formerly called Caretha. Opposite to the Pro- 
montory of Taurus are the Chelidom^e^ as many in num- 
ber, and extremely dangerous to mariners. Further on we 
find Leucolla with its town, the Pactyse^ Lasia, Nymphais, 
Maoris, and Megista, the city on which last no longer exists. 
After these there are many that are not worthy of notice. 
Opposite, however, to Cape Chimserais Dolichiste^ Choerogy- 
lion, Crambussa«, Ehoge^ Enagora, eight miles m circum- 
ference, the two islands of Dsedala'°, the three of Cr^a , 

1 Or Cleides, meaning the " Keys." This was a group of smaU islands 
lying to the north-east of Cyprus. The name of the islands was after- 
wards transferred by some geographer to the Cape which Phny above 
calls Dinee, and others Dinaretum. 2 Cape Acamas, now Pilano. 

3 Or the " Sacred Garden." The names of this and the Salamim® do 
not appear to be known to the modern geographers. 

4 This is identified by Beaufort with the islet called Boeshat, which is 
separated by a narrow channel from the Lycian shore. The others do 
not seem to have been identified. Attelebussa is supposed to take its 
name from a kind of destructive grasshopper without wmgs, caUed by 
the Greeks arreXe^os. 

5 Situate oflF the commencement of the sea-coast of Pamphyha, on tne 
borders of Lycia. Beaufort speaks of them as five m number ; he chd 
not meet with any of the dangers of the navigation here mentioned by 
Phny. The Greeks still caU them Chehdonise, and the Itahan sailors 
Cehdoni, which the Turks have corrupted into Shehdan. 

6 Hardouin supposes these four islands to be the names of the group 
forming the Pacty®. The names given appear to signify, the "Wild 
or « Kough Islands," the " Isle of the Nymphs," the " Long Island, and 
the " Greatest Island." They were ofi" the coast of Lycia, and seeni to 
have belonged to the Ehodians. The modem name of Megista is E.a- 
stelorizo, according to Ansart. r .^ • 

7 Or Dohche, the " Long Island," in the Lycian Sea, west ot the rums 
of Myra. Its modern name is Kakava. It is now umnhabited. _ 

8 Still known as Grambousa, a smaU island ofi* the east coast of Lycia. 
There seems to have been another of the same name off the Lycian coast. 

9 An island off the coast of Lycia. r -r^ j i 

10 Hardouin thinks that they were opposite to the city of Dsedala on 
the coast of Caria.

Strongyle, and over against Sidyma^ the isle of Antiocluis. 
Towards the mouth of the river Grlaucus", there are Lagussa^, 
Macris, Didymae, Helbo, Scope, Aspis, Telandria, the town 
of wliich no longer exists, and, in the vicinity of Caunus^, 
Khodussa. 

CHAP. 36. — EHODES. 

But the fairest of them all is the free island of Eliodes, 
125, or, if we would rather believe Isidorus, 103 miles in 
circumference. It contains the inhabited cities of Lindos, 
Camii^us^, and lalysus^, now called Ehodos. It is distant 
from Alexandria in Egypt, according to Isidorus, 583 miles ; 
but, according to Eratosthenes, 469. Mucianus says, that 
its distance from Cyprus is 166. This island was formerly 
called Ophiussa'', Asteria^, JEthria^, Trinacrie^", Corymbia^\ 
Poeeessa^^, AtabjTia^^, from the name of one of its kings ; and, 
in later times, Macaria^"* and Oloessa^^ The islands of the 
Hhodians are Carpathus^^, which has given its name to the

^ Probably so called from the number of hares found there. 

^ On the coast of Caria. 

^ Still kno\ATi as Lindo and Camiro, according to D'Anville. 

^ One of the three ancient Doric cities of Rhodes. It lay three-quarters 
of a mile to the south-west of the city of Rhodes, willi which Pliny 
seems here to confound it. Its site is occupied by a Aillage which still 
bears the name of laliso, and where a few ancient renuims are to be foimd. 

"^ From its productiveness of serpents. 

8 Either from Asterius, its former king, or from its being a *' constella- 
tion" of the sea. 

9 Probably because of the clearness and serenity of its atmosphere. 
See B. ii. c. 62. 

^^ From its three-cornered shape. 

^^ Perhaps so called from its fruitfulness in ivy, in Greek tcopv^jSi'iOpay 
or else from Kopv^Pos, " a summit," from its elevated position.

from the temple of Jupiter Tabyrius, which Appian speaks of as situate 
in this island, 

» The " fortunate," or " blessed" island.

surrounding sea ; Casos\ formerly known as Aclme^ ; Ni- 
S}TOS^, twelve miles distant from Cnidos, and formerly 
called Porphyris"* ; and, in the same vicinity, midway between 
libodes and Cnidos, Syme^. This island is thirty-seven miles 
and a half in circumference, and welcomes us with eight fine 
harbours. Besides these islands, there are, in the vicinity 
of Ehodes, those of Cyclopis, Teganon, Cordylussa^, the 
four islands called Diabetse^, Hymos, Chalce^, with its city 
of that name, Seutlussa^, Nartliecussa^", Dimastos, Progne ; 
and, off Cnidos, Cisserussa, Therionarce, and Calydne^^ with 
the three towns of Notium, Nisyros, and Mendeterus. In 
Arconnesus'^ there is the town of Ceramus. Off the coast 
of Caria, there are the islands known as the Argise, twenty 
in number ; also Hyetussa^^, Lepsia, and Leros. 

The most noted island, however, in this gulf is that of 
Cos^^, fifteen miles distant from Halicarnassus, and 100 in 
circumference, according to tlie opinion of many writers. 
It was formerly called Merope ; according to Staphylus, Cea ; 

* Mentioned by Homer, II. ii. 676, See also B. iv. c. 23 of the present 
work. It is described by Boss as a single ridge of mountaias, of con- 
siderable height. 2 Signifying " sea-foam." 

3 StiU known as Nicero. 

* From its production of the ' murex,' or ' pm'ple.' 

5 Now called Symi, a small island off the south-west coast of Caria, 
at the mouth of the Gulf of Doris, to the west of the Promontory of 
Cynossema. 

^ Now called the Island of St. Catherine, according to Ansart. 

7 Stephanus Byzantinus mentions these islands as lying in the vicinity 
at Syme. Perhaps they are the group lying to the south of it, now 
called Siskle. 

^ Distant about fifty miles from Carpathus, or Skarpanto. It was 
probably subject to Rhodes, in the vicinity of which it was situate. Its 
present name is Chalki. 

'■^ An island, according to Hardouin, not far from HaHcarnassus, on 
the coast of Ionia. 

^'^ So called from its productiveness of the vdp9r]^, or ferula. 

^^ More probably Calydnse, because there were several islands forming 
the group, of which Calymna was the chief. See B. iv. c. 23, where 
Pliny mentions only one towai, that of Coos. There are some remains 
of th3 ancient towns still to be seen. 

'2 A small island of Caria, south of Halicarnassus. It is now called 
Orak-Ada. 

^^ Probably so called from the almost continual rains there. 

^* Now called Stanko, or Stancliio, a corruption of es tuv Kw,

Meropis, as Dionysius tells us ; and, after that, iN'ympliaea. 
In this island there is jNIoiint Prion. iS^isyros\ formerly 
called PorT)hyris, is supposed to have been severed from tlie 
island of Cos. AVe next come to the island of Caryanda'-^, 
•VNTith a city of that name, and that of Pidosus^, not far 
from Halicarnassus. In the Gulf of Ceramieus we also find 
Priaponnesos^, Hipponnesos, Psyra, Mya,Lampsa, JEmyndus, 
Passala, Crusa, Pinnicussa, Sepiussa^, and Melano. At a 
short distance from the mainland is an island which bears 
the name of Cinaedopolis, from the circumstance that King 
Alexander left behind there certain persons of a most 
disgraceful character. 

CHAP. 37. — SAMOS. 

Tlie coast of Ionia has the islands of Trageae, Corseae^, 
and Icaros, which has been previously" mentioned ; Lade**, 
formerly called Late ; and, among others of no note, the two 
Camelida)^, in the vicinity of Miletus ; and the three Ti'o- 
giliae''^, near Mycale, consisting of Philion, Argennon, and 
Sandalion. There is Samos also, a free'' it^land, eighty-seven 
miles in circumference, or, according to Isidorus, 100: Ari- 
stotle tells us, that it was at first called Parthenia'^, after 

^ ^Tiich has been previously mentioned in this Chapter. 

2 In C. 29, PUny has mentioned a Caryanda on the n.ainland. It is 
probable that there was a town on the maiiiland and another in the 
island of the same name. Leake says, that there can be Uttle doubt that 
the large peninsula, towards the west end of whicli is the fine harbour 
called by the Turks Pasha Limani, is the ancient island of Caryanda, now 
joined to the mainland by a narrow sandy istlunus. 

3 The island of Hyali, near the harbour of MefTi, on the coast of 
Caria, aceorchng to Dupinet. 

■* Probably so called from the worship of the god Priapus there. 
5 Few, if any, of these islets can now be recognized. S/]iiussa was 
probably so called from the abundance of the sepia, or cutlle-llsh, there. 
^ Over against the isle of Samos. ^ 13. iv. c. 23. 

8 Near the city of Miletus. 

9 So called from their resemblance to camels.

called by the Greeks Samo, and by the Turks Su^am Adassi.

according to Strabo, it received its name from tlie river Partheniua.

that Dryussa\ and then Anthemussa^. To these names 
Aristocritus has added Melamphyllus^ and Cyparissia'* : 
other WTiters, again, call it Parthenoarussa^ and Stephane^. 
The rivers of this island are the Imbrasus, the Chesius, and 
the Ibettes. There are also the fountains of Gigartho and 
Leucothea ; and Mount Cercetius. In the vicinity of Samos 
are the islands of Ehypara, Nymphsea, and Achillea. 

CHAP. 38. — CHIOS. 

At a distance of ninety-four miles from Samos is the free 
island of Chios'', its equal in fame, with a town of the same 
name. Ephorus says, that the ancient name of this island 
was ^^thalia ; Metrodorus and Cleobulus tell us, that it had 
the name of Chia from the nymph Chioiie ; others again say, 
that it was so called from the word signifying snow^ ; it was 
also called Macris and Pityusa^. It has a mountain called 
Pelennseus ; and the Chian marble is well known. It is 125^^ 
miles in circumference, according to the ancient writers ; Isi- 
dorus however makes it nine more. It is situate between 
Samos and Lesbos, and, for the most part, lies opposite to 
Erythrae". 

The adjacent islands are Thallusa^^, by some writers called 
Daphnusa'^, CEiiussa, Elaphitis, Euryanassa, and Arginusa, 
with a town of that name. All these islands are in the vici- 
nity of Ephesus, as also those called the Islands of Pisistra- 
tus, Anthinse, Myonnesos, Diarreusa, — in both of these last 
there were cities, now no longer in existence, — Poroselene^*, 

^ From its numerous oaks. 2 From tlie abundance of its flowers. 

^ " Of dark," or " black foliage ; " in allusion probably to its cypresses. 

^ " Cypress-bearing." 

* This is not improbably a compound, formed by a mistake of the 
copyists, of the two names, Parthenia and Aryusa, mentioned by 
Herachdes, 

^ " The Crown." This island was the bu'th-place of Pythagoras. 

7 Now known as Khio, Scio, Saka Adassi, or Saksadasi. Chios was 
declared free by the Dictator Sulla. *• Xnov, gen. Xiovos. 

^ Macris, from its length, and Pityusa, from its pine-trees. 

^0 Dalechamps says 112 is the correct measm'ement. 

1^ Mentioned in C. 31 of the present Book. 

^2 Meaning " green and flourishing." 

13 " Productive of laurels." None of these islets appear to have been 
rccogTiized by their modern names. 

^^ By Strabo called Pordoselene. He says that the islands ia its

Tvitli a city of that name, Cercire, Halone\ Commone, 
llletia, Lepria and Eliesperia, Procusae, BolbuLr, Phana?, 
Priapos, Syce, Melaue, JEnare, Sidiisa, Pele, Drymusa*, 
Anhydros, Scopelos^, Sycnssa, Marathussa, Psile, Perirreusa, 
and many others of no note. In the main sea lies the 
celebrated island of Teos, with a city"* of that name, seventy- 
o^e miles and a half distant from Chios, and the same from 
the Erythrcne. 

In the vicinity of Smyrna are the Peristerides*, Carteria, 
Alopece, Elsenssa, Bachina, Pystira, Crommyonnesos, and 
Megale^. Facing Troas there are the Ascanire, and the 
three islands called Plateae. "We find also the Lamiiie, the 
two islands called Plitanioe, Plate, Scopelos, Getone, Arthe- 
don, CoelcT, Lagussa?, and Didymge. 

CHAP. 39. LESBOS. 

But Lesbos', distant from Chios sixty-five miles, is the 
most celebrated of them all. It was formerly called Himerte, 
Lasia, Pelasgia, ^gira, ^thiope, and Macaria, and is 
famous for its nine cities. Of these, however, that of Pyrrha 
has been swallowed up by the sea, Arisbe^ has perished by 
an earthquake, and 5lethymna is now united to Antissa** ; 
these lie in the vicinity of nine cities of Asia, along a 
coast of thirty-seven miles. The towns of Agamede and 

vicinity were forty in number ; of which Phny here gives the names of 
two-and-twenty. ^ South of Proconncsus ; now called Aloni. 

* Near the city of Clazomenae. It is now called Vourla, accorcUng 
to Ansart. ^ Kow Koiitali, according to Ansart. 

* We learn from Strabo and other writers, tliat tliis city was on a ]icn- 
insiila, and that it stood on the southern side of tlie isthnuis, coiniecting 
Mount Mhnas with the mainland of Lydia. It was the birth-place of 
Anacreon and Ilccataeus. 

* Or the " Dove Islands ;" probably from the multitude of those birds 
found on those islands. 

^ Now called Antigona, according to Ansart. 

' Now Mitylene, or Metelin. 

^ We find it also stated by Herodotus, that this island was destroyed 
by the Methymnwans. The cities of Mitylene, Melhynma, Erebus, 
Pyrrha, Antissa, and Arisbe, originally formed the vEolian HexapoUs, 
or Confederation of Six Cities. 

^ The ruins found by Pocoeke at Calas Limneonas, ncirtli-east of Capo 
Sigi'i, may be those of Antissa. This j)laee was the bhth-phice of Ter- 
pander, the mveutor of the seven- stringed lyre. 



488 PLINT's NATURAL HISTORY. [Book V. 

Hiera have also perished. Eresos\ Pyrrlia, and the free 
city of Mitylene^, still survive, the last of which was a 
powerful city for a space of 1500 years. The circumference 
of the whole island is, according to Isidorus, 168 miles^, 
but the older writers say 195. Its mountains are, Lepe- 
thymnus, Ordymnus, Macistus, Creon, and Olympus. It is 
distant seven miles and a half from tlie nearest point of the 
mainland. The islands in its vicinity are, Sandaleon, alid 
the five called Leucae"* ; Cydonea^, which is one of them, 
contains a warm spring. The Arejinussre^ are four miles 
distant from Mge'^ ; after them come Phellusa^ and Pedna. 
Beyond the Hellespont, and opposite the shore of Sigeum, 
lies Tenedos^, also known by the names of Leucophrys^°, 
Phcenice, and Lyrnesos. It is distant from Lesbos fifty-six 
miles, and twelve and a half from Sigeum. 

CHAP. 40. (32.) — THE HELLESPOTfT ATfD MTSIA, 

The tide of the Hellespont now begins to run with greater 
violence, and the sea beats against the shore, undermining 
with its eddies the barriers that stand in its way, until it 
has succeeded in separating Asia from Europe. At this 
spot is the promontory which we have already mentioned 
as Trapeza" ; ten miles distant from which is the city of 

^ Or Eressus, according to Strabo. It stood on a HU, reacliing down 
to the sea. Its ruins are said to be near a place still called Eresso. It 
was the birth-place of the phUosoplier Theopln-astus, the disciple of 
Aristotle. 2 g^in called Mitylene, or MeteUn. 

3 Strabo makes it about only 137 miles. ^ Or the White Islands. 

5 So caUed fi-om its fruitfulness in quinces, or " Mala Ci/donia." 

^ These were three small islands, near the mainland of yEolis. It 
was off these islands that the ten generals of the Athenians gaiued 
a victory over the Spartans, B.C. 406. The modern name of these 
islands is said to be Janot. 

7 One of the Leuca?, previously mentioned. 

8 So called from the (peWbs, or " cork," which it produced. 

9 Still known as Tenedos, near the mouth of the Hellespont. Here 
the Grreeks were said to have concealed their fleet, to induce the Trojans 
to think that tliey had departed, and then introduce the wooden horse 
within their walls.

Abydos\ ^Yhere the straits are only seven stadia wide ; then 
the town of Percote"^ ; Lampsacus^, at first called Pityusa ; 
the colony of Parium'', which Homer calls by the name of 
Adrastia ; the town of Priapos^ ; the river ^Esepus'' ; Zelia^ ; 
and then the Propontis'^, tliat beinf? the name given to 
the tract of sea where it enlarges. We then come to the 
river Granicus^, and the liarbour of Artace'", wliere a town 
formerly stood. Beyond this is an island which Alexander 
joined to the continent, and upon which is Cyzicus'', a city 
of the Milesians, which was formerly called Arctonnesos'-, 
Dolionis, and Dindymis ; above it are the heights of 
Mount Dindymus'^. We then come to the towns of Placia, 
Ariace^^, and Scylace ; in the rear of which places is jMount 
Olympus, known as the " Mysian Olympus,*' and the city of 
Olympena. There are also the rivers Horisius'^ and Rhyn- 
dacus '^, formerly called the Lycus ; this last river rises in 
Lake Artynias, near Miletopolis, and receives the Macestos, 
and many other streams, dividing in its course Asia'' from 
Bithynia'^. 

^ Opposite to Seatos, made famous by the loves of Hero and Leander. 
Aidos, or Avido, a village on the Hellespont, is thought to occupy its site. 

2 Now called Bergase, according to D'Anville. 

^ Its ruins are stiU known as Lapsaki. Tliis important city was cele- 
brated for its wine, and was the cliicf seat of the worsliip of the god 
Priapus. "* Its site is now called Camanar, according to D'Anville. 

* According to Ansart, the modern Caraboa marks its site. 

® Now called the Satal-dere, accorchng to Ansart. 

^ Its locality was not far from the modem Biga, according to Ansart. 

^ Now the Sea of Marmora. 

^ Mentioned in C. 33 of the present Book. 

^^ Now called Artaki, or Erdok, a town of Mysia, and a Milesian 
colony. A poor town now occupies its site. 

*' Its ruins are called by the Turks Bal Kiz, probably meaning " Old 
Cyzicus." There are many subterraneous passages, and the ruins are of 
considerable extent. Its tem])les and storehouses appear to have been 
built on a scale of great magnificence. See I'liny, B. xxxvi. e. 15. 

^■^ The " Island of the Bears," whicli animals frequented the moim- 
tain in its yicinity. ^^ Called Diiulyniuni hy Herodotus; 

probably the modem Morad Dagh, in which the river lieriuus rises. 

14 Now called Saki, according to Ansart. 

15 Now called the Lartaeho, according to Ansart. 

16 Previously mentioned in C. 32 of the j)resent Book. 

17 In its limited sense; considered as a portion only of Asia Minor. 

1^ On the west it bordered on Mysia, and on the south on Thrygiaand 
Galatia, wliile the eastern boundary seems to have been less deliiula. 



490 flint's natural HISTOET. [Book V. 

This coimtry was at first called by the name of Cronia, 
after that, Thessalis, and then Malianda and Strymonis. The 
people of it are by Homer called Halizones\ from the fact 
that it was a nation begirt by the sea. There was formerly 
a vast city here, Attussa by name ; at present there are 
tAvelve cities in existence ; among which is Grordiucome^, 
otherwise Juliopolis ; and, on the coast, Dascylos". We 
then come to the river Grelbes'* ; and, in the interior, the 
town of Helgas, or Grermanicopolis, which has also the 
other name of Booscoete^ ; Apamea^, now more generally 
known as Myrlea of the Colophonians : the river Etheleus 
also, the ancient boundary of Troas, and the commencement 
of Mysia. Next to this comes the gulf^ into which the 
river Ascanius flows, the town of Bryllion^, and the rivers 
Hylas and Cios, with a town of the same name as the last- 
mentioned river ; it was founded by the Milesians at a place 
which was called Ascania of Phrygia, as an entrepot for the 
trade of the Phrygians who dwelt in the vicinity. We may 
therefore look upon this as a not ineligible opportunity for 
making further mention of Phrj^gia. 

CHAP. 41. — PHRTGIA. 

Phrygia lies above Troas, and the peoples already men- 

^ Ephorus, as quoted by Stephanus Byzantinus, says, that the Hali- 
zones inhabited the district lying between Caria, Mysia, and Lydia. 
Hesychius incorrectly places them in Paphlagonia. 

2 Meaning the " Village of Grordius," one of its ancient kings. It was 
also called Gordium. After falling to decay, it was rebuilt by Augustus, 
and called Juhopohs. It is celebrated in history as the place where 
Alexander the Great cut the Grordian knot ; the scene of the adventure 
being the Acropolis of the town, the former palace of King Gordius. 

3 Therewere several Asiatic cities of the simdar name of Dascyhum. The 
site of the one here mentioned does not appear to have been ascertained. 

4 More generaUy read " Gebes." 5 The " BuU's Bed," or " Den." 
It probably took its second name from the Roman general Germanicus. 

^ Now called Medania, or Mutania. It received its name of Apamea 
fi'om Prusias, king of Bithynia, in compHment to his wife. In the time 
of the first Csesars, it was made a Roman colony. 

^ The Bay of Cios. The river runs into a lake, formerly known as 
Lake Ascanius ; probably that mentioned by Pliny in B. xxsi. c. 10. 

^ Stephanus Byzantinus says that it was the same as the town of Cios, 
or Cius, here mentioned as near to it. It was on the shores of the 
Propontis.

re celebrated towns there, besides those ah-eady men-

ihors who say that the Mcesi, the Brygi, and the Thyni 

issed over from Europe, and that from them are descended 

" peoples called the Mysi, Phryges, and Bithyni. 

CHAP. 42. GALATIA AND THE ADJOINING NATIONS. 

On this occasion also it seems that we ought to speak of 
Galatia% which lies above Phrygia, and includes the greater 
part of the territory taken from that province, as also its 

1 Cape Baba, or Santa Maria ; the south-western promontory of 
the Troacl. 

2 In Plirygia Epictctus, or " Conquered Phrygia, so called Irom its 
conquest by ccrtam of the kmgs of Bithynia. Strabo calls this place a 
"small city, or hill-fortress, towards Lydia." It was probably situate 
near the source of the Macestus, now the SusughcrU Su, or the Simaul 
Su, as it is called in its upper course. 

3 The place from wliich the citizens were removed to Apamea, as men- 
tioned in C. 29 of the present Book. Hamilton (Researches, &amp;c., p. 499)

disappeared. Hamilton found extensive ruins of an ancient city about 
three miles north of the modern Khonos. It was one of the early Chris- 
tian chui-ches of A&gt;ia, and the Apostle Paul addressed oneot liis Kpistles 
to the people of this place. It does not appear from it that he liad ever

Ambitouti ; those who dwell in Mseonia and Paphlagonia 
are called the Trocmi. Cappadocia stretches along to the 
north-east of Gralatia, its most fertile parts being possessed 
by the • Tectosages and the Tentobodiaci. These are the 
nations by which those parts are occupied ; and they are 
divided into peoples and tetrarchies, 195 in number. Its 
towns are, among the Tectosages, Ancyra^ ; among the 
Trocmi, Tavium^ ; and, among the Tolistobogi, Pessinus*.

ginally b'^longed to Phrygia, and its mythical founder was Midas, the 
son of Grordius, who was said to have found an anchor on the spot, and 
accordingly given the name to the town ; wliich story woidd, however, 
as it has been observed, imply that the name for anchor (dyKvpa) was the 
same in the Greek and the Phrygian languages. The Tectosages, who 
settled here about B.C. 277, are supposed to have been fi'om the neigh- 
boxu'liood of Toulouse. It is now called Angora, or Engareh ; and the 
fine hair of the Angora goat may have formed one of the staple com- 
modities of the place, which had a very considerable trade. The cliief 
monument of antiquity here is the marble temple of the Emperor 
Augustus, built in his honour during his lifetime. In the inside is the 
Latin inscription knovra as the monumenfum, or marmor Ancyranwm^ 
containing a record of the memorable actions of Augustus. The ruins 
here are otherwise interesting in a liigh degree.

Agdistis, whose temple, filled with riches, stood on a hill outside of 
the city.

of Atta?a, and afterwards by a settlement of the Bottia'ans, called An core, 
or Helicore, wliich was destroyed by the Mysians. On this spot, sliortly 
after the death of Alexander the Great, Antigonus built a city which 
he named after liimself, Antigonaea ; but Lysimachus soon alterwards 
changed the name into Nicsea, in honour of his wile. Under the kings 
of Bithynia, it was often the royal residence, and it long disputed with 
Nicomedia the rank of capital of Bithynia. Tlie modern JznLk is only

also ii second place called Prusa\ at the foot of Mount 
Hypius. Pythopolis, Parthenopolis, and Coiyphanta are 
no longer in existence. Along the coast we find the rivers 
^sms, Bryazon, Plataneus, Areus, ^syros, Geodos, also 
called Chrjsorroas^, and the promontory ^ upon which once 
stood the town of Megarice. The gulf that here runs 
inland received the name of Craspedites from the circum- 
stance of that to^Ti lying, as it were, upon its skirts Asta- 
cum^ also, formerly stood here, from which the same gulf 
has received the name of the ' Astacenian' : the town of 
Libyssa^ formerly stood at the spot where we now see 
nothing but the tomb of Hannibal. At the bottom of 
the gulf lies Nicomedia'', a famous city of Bithynia ; then 
comes the Promontory of Leucatas^ by which the Asta- 
cenian G-ulf IS bounded, and thirty-seven miles distant 
from Nicomedia; and then, the land again approaching 
the other side, the straits'-* which extend as far as the 
city are stiU in existence. Littre seems to think tliat there are two 
]Nicseas meant m these passages ; but it would seem that the same place 
13 aUuded to m both Hues. The only tiling that seems to give counte- 
nance to Littre's supposition (in which he is supported by Hardouin) 
IS, the expression " Et Prusa item altera." 

1 It has been suggested, that this is only another name for the town 
ot Uos, previously mentioned ; but it is most proljable that they were 
distinct places, and that this was originaUy caUed Cierus, and belon^red 
to the territory of Heraclea, but was conquered by King Prusias, who 
named it after hhnself. It stood to the north-west of the other Prusa.

eastern corner of tlie Smus Astacenus, or Gulf of Izmid. It was the 
chief residence of the kings of Bithynia, and one of the most splendid

Thracian Bosporus. Upou these are situate Chalcedon^, 
a free town, sixty-two miles from ]S'icomedia, formerly 
called Proeerastis^j then Colpusa, and after that the " City 
of the Blind," from the circumstance that its founders 
did not know where to build their city, Byzantium being 
only seven stadia distant, a site which is preferable in every 
respect. 

In the interior of Bithj-nia are the colony of Apamea', 
the Agrippenses, the Juliopolita?, and Bithmion'' ; the rivers 
Syrium, Laphias, Pharnacias, Alces, Serinis, Lila^us, Scopius, 
and Ilieras^, which separates Bithynia from Galatia. Be- 
yond Chalcedon formerly stood Chrysopolis^, and then Ni- 
copolis, of which the gulf, upon which stands the Port of 
Amycus^, still retains the name ; then the Promontory of 
IS^aulochum, and Estise*, a temple of Neptune^. A\^e then

Europe, the distance across being half a mile ; it is distant 
twelve miles and a half from Chalcedon. The first entrance 
of this strait is eight miles and three-quarters wide, at the

modem Scutari, and it is said that the modem Greeks call it Chalkodon, 
and the Turks Kadi-Kioi. Its destruction was completed by the Turks, 
who used its materials for the construction of the mosques and other 
buildings of Constantinople. 

2 So called, Hardouin thinks, from its being opposite to the Golden 
Horn, or promontory on which Byzantium was built.

coimtiy for cattle, and noted for the excellence of its cheese, as men- 
tioned by Pliny, B. xi. c. 42. Antinoiis, the favourite of the Emperor 
Adrian, was bom here, as Pausauias informs us. Its site does not 
appear to be known, 

* These rivers do not appear to have been identified by tlie modem 
geographers. 

6 The modem Scutari occupies its site. Dionysius of Byzantium 
states, that it was called Chr^sopohs, eitlier because the Persians nia&lt;le 
it the place of deposit for the gold which they levied from tlie citici", or 
else from Chrj'ses, a son of Agamemnon and Chryscis.

Thyni occupy the whole of the coast, the Bithyni the in- 
terior. This is the termination of Asia, and of the 282 
peoples, that are to be found between the Grulf of Lycia^

the Hellespont and Propontis to the Thracian Bosporus as 
beino[ 239 miles ; from Chalcedon to Sigeum, Isidorus makes 
the distance 322-|-. 

CHAP. 44. — THE ISLANDS OP THE PROPONTIS. 

The islands of the Propontis are, before Cyzicus, Elaphon- 
nesus"*, from whence comes the Cyzican marble ; it is also 
known by the names of Neuris and Proconnesus. Next 
come Ophiussa^, Acanthus, Phcebe, Scopelos, Porphyrione, 
Halone^, with a city of that name, Delphacia, Polydora, and 
Artaceon, with its city. There is also, opposite to Nico- 
media, Demonnesos^ ; and, beyond Heraclea, and opposite 
to Bithynia, the island of Thynias, by the barbarians called 
Bithynia ; the island of Antiochia : and, at the mouth of 
the Ehyndacus, Besbicos^, eighteen miles in circumference ; 
the islands also of Elsea, the two called Ehodussae, and those 
of Erebinthus^, Megale, Chalcitis^°, and Pity odes ^\ 

^ Called Phinopolis in most of the editions. It is very doubtful 
whether this passage ought not to be translated, " At a distance thence of 
eight miles and three-quarters is the first entrance to tliis strait, at the 
spot," &amp;c. We have, however, adopted the rendering of Holland, Ajas- 
son, and Littre. 2 Mentioned hi C. 28 of the present Book. 

3 In B. iv. c. 24. ^ Or " Deer Island." 

^ Now Afzia, according to D'AnvUle. 

^ There is still an island in the Sea of Marmora known by the name 
Alon, which is separated from the north-western extremity of the Penin- 
sula of Cyzicus by a narrow channel. 

7 Hesycliius says, that there were two islands near Byzantium called 
by the common name of Demonncsi, but severally having the names of 
Chalcitis and Pityusa. Phny, on the other hand, places Demonnesus 
opposite to Nicomedia, and at the same time mentions Chalcitis and 
Pityodes (^ probably the same as Pityusa) as distinct places. D'Anvihe 
calls Demonnesus " The Isle of Princes." 

8 The position assigned to this island by Pliny and Strabo corresponds 
with that of Kalohmno, a small island ten miles north of the mouth of 
the Khyndacus. ^ Now called Prota, according to Parisot. 

^^ So called from its copper-mines ; now called Khalki, or Karki.
